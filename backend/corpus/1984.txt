' ONE 

It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were 
striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin muzzled into his 
breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly 
through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though net 
quickjy enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust trom entcnng 
along with him. 

The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At 
one end of it a colored poster, too large for indoor display, had 
been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, 
more than a meter wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, 
with a heavy black mustache and ruggedly handsome features. 
Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even 
at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the 
electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part 
of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat 
was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine, and 
had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting 
several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift 
^ shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. 
K It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the 
eyes follow you about when you move. Big Brother Is 
Watching You, the caption beneath it ran. 

Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures 
which had something to do with the production of pig iron. 
The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled 
mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand 
wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, 
though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument 
(the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was 
no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the 
window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagerness of his body 
merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uni¬ 
form of the Party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally 
sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor 
blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended. 

Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world 
l looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were 
i whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun 
t was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no 
color in anything except the posters that were plastered every¬ 
where. The black-mustachio’d face gazed down from every

commanding corner. There was one on the house front im¬ 
mediately opposite. Big Brother Is Watching You. the cap¬ 
tion said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston’s own.# 
Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped £ 
fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the 
single word INGSOC. In the f-ar distance a helicopter skimmed 
down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a blue¬ 
bottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the 
Police Patrol, snooping into people’s windows. The patrols did 
not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered. 

Behind Winston’s back the voice from the telescreen was 
still babbling away about pig iron and the overfulfillment of the 
Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and trans¬ 
mitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above 
the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; 
moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision 
which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well 
as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you 
were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on 
what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual 
wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched 
everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your 
wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live—did live, from 
habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound 
you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every move-^, 
ment scrutinized. 

Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; 
though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilo¬ 
meter away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered 
vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought 
with a sort of vague distaste—this was London, chief city of 
Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces 
of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory 
g; that should tell him whether London had always been quite 
like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting nincteenth- 
H? century hdlises, their sides shored up with balks of timber, their 
KV windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with cor- 

--rugafetTiron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? 

And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air 
and the willow herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the 
places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there 
had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chick¬ 
en houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing * 
remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tab- I 
leaux, occurring against no background and mostly unintclli-T- 

gible.

The Ministry of Truth—Minitrue, in Newspeak*—was 
.startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an 
enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, 
soaring up, terrace after terrace, three hundred meters into the 
air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, 
picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three 
slogans of the Party: 


WAR IS PEACE 

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY 

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. 

The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand 
rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications 
below. Scattered about London there were just three otb' 
buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did 
they dwarf the surrounding architecture that fr~:n the roof of 
Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultane¬ 
ously. They were the homes of the four Ministries between 
which the entire apparatus of government was divided: the 
Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, enter¬ 
tainment, education, and the fine arts; the Ministry of Peace, 
which concerned itself with war; the Ministry of Love, which 
{maintained law and order; and the Ministry of Plenty, which 
was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Now- 
speak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty. 

The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There 
were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the 
Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometer of it. It was a 
place impossible to enter except on official business, and then 
only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entangle¬ 
ments, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even the 
streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla- 
faced guards m black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons. 

Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into 
the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to 

fa « ns , the .telescreen. He crossed the room into the 
tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he 

IwL iacnficed h, s lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that

teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like 
a dose of medicine. * j 

Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his.' 
eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallow¬ 
ing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the 
head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burn¬ 
ing in his belly died down and the world began to look more 
cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked 
victory cigarettes and incautiously held it upright, where¬ 
upon the tobacco fell out onto the floor. With the next he was 
more successful. He went back to the living room and sat down 
at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From 
the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and 
a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a mar¬ 
bled cover. 

For some reason the telescreen in the living room was in an 
unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the 
end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in 
the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there 
was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and 
which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended 
to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well 
back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the 
telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, 
but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not b$ 
seen. It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had 
suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do. 

But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just 
taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its 
smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind 
that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. 

He could guess, however, that the book was much older than 
that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk 
shop in a slOmmy quarter of the town (just what quarter he 
did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately 
by an overwhelming desire to possess it. Party members were 
supposed not to go into ordinary shops (“dealing on the free 
market,” it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, be¬ 
cause there were various things such as shoelaces and razor &lt; 
blades which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. 

He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then 
had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At 
the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular 
purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his brief case. Evafi- &lt; 
with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession?! 

The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This 

8 


was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer 
i*any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it 
would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in 
a forced-labor camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder 
and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic in¬ 
strument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured 
one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a 
feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written 
on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink pencil. 
Actually he was not used to writing by hand. Apart from very 
short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speak- 
write, which was of course impossible for his present purpose. 
He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a 
second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the 
paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote: 

April 4th, 1984. 


He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended 
upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any certainty 
that this was 1984. It must be round about that date, since he 
was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that 
he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible 
nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two. 

V For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he 
writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind 
hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, 
and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word 
doublethink . For the first time the magnitude of what he had 
undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate 
with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the 
future would resemble the present, in which case it would not 
listen to him, or it would be different from it, and his predica¬ 
ment would be meaningless. 

For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The tele¬ 
screen had changed over to strident military music. It was 
curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of 
expressing himself, but even to havq forgotten what it was that 
he had originally intended to say. I*or weeks past he had been 
making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his 
mind that anything would be needed except courage. The 
actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer 
to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been 

£“ n “ vl ,ns,de h i S head ’ ,itcral, y for years 8 At this moment" 

varTr^p’ m V en ™ ono, °S ue had dried up. Moreover, his 

varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not 

9 





scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. The 
seconds were ticking by. He was conscious of nothing except 
the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin 
above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness 
caused by the gin. 

Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly 
aware of what he was setting down. His small but childish 
handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first its 
capital letters and finally even its full stops: 



April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One 
very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed some¬ 
where in the Mediterranean. Audience much amused by shots 
of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter 
after him. first you saw him wallowing along in the water like 
a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gun- 
sights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned 
pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in 
the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank, then 
you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering 
over it. there was a middleaged woman might have been a jew- 
ess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old 
in her arms, little boy screaming with fright and hiding his 
head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right 
into her and the woman putting her arms around him and com-Q 
for ting him although she was blue with fright herself, all the 
time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her 
arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted 
a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went 
all to matchwood, then there was a wonderful shot of a childs 
arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a 
camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot 
of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the 
prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and 
shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of the 
kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the _ 
police turned her turned her out i don’t suppose anything hap¬ 
pened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole

Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering

that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary 
today. 

1 It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything 
so nebulous could be said to happen. 

It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Depart¬ 
ment, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs 
out of the cubicles and grouping them in the center of the hall, 
opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes 
Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle 
rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never 
spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them 
was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not 
know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction 
Department. Presumably—since he had sometimes seen her 
with oily hands and carrying a spanner—she had some me¬ 
chanical job on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a 
bold-looking girl of about twenty-seven, with thick dark hair, 
a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scar¬ 
let sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound 
several times around the waist of her overalls, just tightly 
enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had 
disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew 
the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey fields 
and cold baths and community hikes and general clcan-mindcd- 
V ness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked 
' nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It 
was always the women, and above all the young ones, who 
were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers 
of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. 
But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more 
dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor 
she had given him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to 
pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with 
black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she 
might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it was true, 
was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasi¬ 
ness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, when¬ 
ever she was anywhere near him. 

The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of 
the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and re¬ 
mote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A momen¬ 
tary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as 
they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member ap¬ 
proaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck 
/ nd a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable 
appearance he had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick 

11 


of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously dis¬ 
arming—in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was a 
gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might*' 
have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuff¬ 
box. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost 
as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely be¬ 
cause he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien’s ur¬ 
bane manner and his prizefighter’s physique. Much more it 
was because of a secretly held belief—or perhaps not even a 
belief, merely a hope—that O'Brien’s political orthodoxy was 
not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And 
again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in 
his face, but simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the ap¬ 
pearance of being a person that you could talk to, if somehow 
you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. Winston had 
never made the smallest effort to verify this guess; indeed, there 
was no way of doing so. At this moment O’Brien glanced at 
his wristwatch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and 
evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the 
Two Minutes Hate was over. He took a chair in the same row 
as Winston, a couple of places away. A small, sandy-haired 
woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between 
them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind. 

The next moment a hideous, grinding screech, as of some 
monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the bigr 
telescreen at the end of the room. It was a noise that set one’s 
teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one’s neck. 

The Hate had started. 

As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of 
the People, had flashed onto the screen. There were hisses 
here and there among the audience. The little sandy-haired 
woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. Goldstein 
was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long 
ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading 
figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, 
and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had 
been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and^^ 
disappeared. The program of the Two Minutes Hate varied 
from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was 
not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor, the earliest 
defiler of the Party’s purity. All subsequent crimes against the 
Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, 
sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was 
still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhe ^ 
beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, 


perhaps even—so it was occasionally rumored—in some hiding 
place in Oceania itself. 

Winston’s diaphragm was constricted. He could never see 
the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It 
was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair 
and a small goatee beard—a clever face, and yet somehow 
inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long 
thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was 
perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, 
had a sheeplike quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual 
venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party—an attack 
so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able 
to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with 
an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than 
oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, 
he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was de¬ 
manding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he 
was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free¬ 
dom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysteri¬ 
cally that the revolution had been betrayed—and all this in 
rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the 
habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained 
Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any . 
Party member would normally use in real life. And all the 
V while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which 
Goldstein’s specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the 
telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian 
army-row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless 
Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and 
vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull, 
rhythmic tramp of the soldiers’ boots formed the background 
to Goldstein’s bleating voice. 

Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncon¬ 
trollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the 
people in the room. The self-satisfied sheeplike face on the 
screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind 
Jt, were too much to be borne; besides, the sight or even the 
thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. 
He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia 
or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these 
powers it was generally at peace with the other. But what was 
strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised 
by everybody, although every day, and a thousand times a day, 
on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his 
V eones were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the gen¬ 
eral gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were—in spite of all 

13 


this, his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there 
were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. A day never, 
passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions" 
were not unmasked by the Thought Police. He was the com¬ 
mander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of 
conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The 
Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also 
whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the 
heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulat¬ 
ed clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. 
People referred to it, if at all, simply as the book. But one knew 
of such things only through vague rumors. Neither the Brother- 
hood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary Party mem¬ 
ber would mention if there was a way of avoiding it. 

In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People ) W * re 
leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops 
of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating 
voicethat came from the screen. The little sandy-hairedwornan

faces in with ?^telfrl™ne\ectr\c current, turning one even 
whole group of people like&lt;screaming lunatic. And yet 
against one’s will into a gn®acg. rcctcd emotion which 

the rage that one felt wm an ™ anothe r like the flame 

could be switched from on ^ Winston’s hatred was no 

of a blowlamp. Thus, at'one m on the contrar y, against

changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, 
an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against 
^ the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his 
helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, 
seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere 
power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization. 

It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this 
way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent 
effort with which one wrenches one’s head away from the pil¬ 
low in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his ha¬ 
tred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind 
him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. 
He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would 
tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint 
Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at the mo¬ 
ment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized why 
it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young 
and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with 
her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple 
waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, 
there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of 
chastity. 

The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had be¬ 
come an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face 
♦ changed into that of a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into 
the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, 
huge and terrible, his submachine gun roaring, and seeming to 
spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the 
people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their 
seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief 
from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big 
Brother, black-haired, black mustachio’d, full of power and 
mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the 
screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was 
merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words 
that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable indi¬ 
vidually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. 

4 , hei ? the f ace of Brother faded away again, and instead 
the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals: 

WAR IS PEACE 
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY 


IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. 

seconds™ f ^* ° f Big Br ° ther seemcd to P^ist for several 
n the screen, as though the impact that it had made 

15 


on everyone’s eyeballs were too vivid to wear off immediately. 

The little sandy-haired woman had flung herself forward over ^ 
the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur 
that sounded like “My Savior!” she extended her arms toward 
the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was ap¬ 
parent that she was uttering a prayer. 

At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, 
slow, rhythmical chant of “B-B! . . . B-B! . . . B-B!” over i 
and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the 
first “B” and the second—a heavy, murmurous sound, some¬ 
how curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed 
to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. 

For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was 
a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming 
emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and 
majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self¬ 
hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of 
rhythmic noise. Winston’s entrails seemed to grow cold. In the 
Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general 
delirium, but this subhuman chanting of “B-B! . . . B-B!" 
always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the 
rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feel¬ 
ings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, 
was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a couple 
of seconds during which the expression in his eyes might con-£* 
ceivably have betrayed him. And it was exactly at this moment 
that the significant thing happened—if, indeed, it did happen. 

Momentarily he caught O'Brien’s eye. O'Brien had stood up. 

He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling 
them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But there was 
a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as 
it took to happen Winston knew—yes, he knew !—that O’Brien 
was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable mes¬ 
sage had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened 
and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through 
their eyes. “I am with you,” O'Brien seemed to be saying to | 
him. “I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all about 
your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don't worry, I 
am on your side!” And then the flash of inteliigence was gone, 
and O'Brien’s face was as inscrutable as everybody clsc’s. i 

That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had 
happened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All that they f 
did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others be¬ 
sides himself were the enemies of the Party. Perhaps the ru-, i 
mors of vast underground conspiracies were true after all—, 
perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in j 

16 


I 


spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to 
^ be sure that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some 
days he believed in it, some days not. There was no evidence, 
only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: 
snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory 
walls—once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement 
of the hands which had looked as though it might be a signal 
of recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had imag¬ 
ined everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without look¬ 
ing at O’Brien again. The idea of following up their momen¬ 
tary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been in¬ 
conceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about 
doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an 
equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even 
that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which 
one had to live. 

Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a 
belch. The gin was rising from his stomach. 

His eyes refocused on the page. He discovered that while he 
sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by 
automatic action. And it was no longer the same cramped 
awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid voluptuously 
over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals— 

DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

over and over again, filling half a page.

forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for 
years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you. t- 

It was always at night—the arrests invariably happened at ' 
night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking 
your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard 
faces round the bed. In the vast majority of cases there was no 
trial, no report of the arrest. People simply disappeared, always 
during the night. Your name was removed from the registers, 
every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, 
your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You 
were abolished, annihilated: vaporized was the usual word. 

For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began 
writing in a hurried untidy scrawl: 

theyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of 
the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot 
you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother — 


He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and 
laid down his pen. The next moment he started violently. 
There was a knocking at his door. 

Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that 
whoever it was might go away after a single attempt. But no, 
the knocking was repeated. The worst thing of all would be to 
delay. His heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, fromT 
long habit, was probably expressionless. He got up and moved 
heavily toward the door.

As he put his hand to the doorknob Winston saw that he 
had left the diary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG 
BROTHER was written all over it, in letters almost big enough 
to be legible across the room. It was an inconceivably stupid 
thing to have done. But. he realized, even in his panic he had 
not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book 
while the ink was wet. 

He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm 
wave of relief flowed through him. A colorless, crushed-look¬ 
ing woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing out¬ 


side. 

“Oh, comrade,” she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, 
“I thought I heard you come in. Do you think you could come 
across and have a look at our kitchen sink? It's got blocked up 
and—” 

It was Mrs. Parsons, the wife of a neighbor on the same 


to 



floor. (“Mrs.’' was a word somewhat discountenanced by the 
Party—you were supposed to call everyone “comrade”—but 
^vith some women one used it instinctively.) She was a woman 
of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impres¬ 
sion that there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston 
followed her down the passage. These amateur repair jobs 
were an almost daily irritation. Victory Mansions were old 
flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. 
The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes 
burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was 
snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam 
when it was not closed down altogether from motives of econ¬ 
omy. Repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to 
be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold 
up even the mending of a window pane for two years. 

“Of course it’s only because Tom isn’t home,” said Mrs. 
Parsons vaguely. 

The Parsons s flat was bigger than Winston’s, and dingy in 
a different way. Everything had a battered, tramplcd-on look, 
as though the place had just been visited by some large violent 
animal. Games impedimenta—hockey sticks, boxing gloves, a 
burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out—lay 
all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty 
dishes and dog-eared exercise books. On the walls were scarlet 
banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and a full-sized 
poster of Big Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbage 
smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through 
y a sharper reek of sweat, which—one knew this at the first 
sniff, though it was hard to say how—was the sweat of some 
person not present at the moment. In another room someone

Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralyzing stupidity, 
a mass of imbecile enthusiasms—one of those completely un¬ 
questioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than j 

the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended. At | 
thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth I 
League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had ft 
managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory 
age. At the Ministry he was employed in some subordinate 
post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other 
hand he was a leading figure on the Sports Committee and all 
the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, j 
spontaneous demonstrations, saving campaigns, and voluntary 
activities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, be¬ 
tween whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at 
the Community Center every evening for the past four years. 

An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testi¬ 
mony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about 
wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had 
gone. I 

“Have you got a spanner?” said Winston, fiddling with the 
nut on the angle-joint. § ' 

“A spanner,” said Mrs. Parsons, immediately becoming in- j 
vertebrate. "I don't know, I'm sure. Perhaps the children—” 
There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the 
comb as the children charged into the living room. Mrs. Par- J 
sons brought the spanner. Winston let out the water and dis¬ 
gustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up 
the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold ; 
water from the tap and went back into the other room. 

“Up with your hands!” yelled a savage voice. 

A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up front 
behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic « 
pistol, while his small sister, about two years younger, made 
the same gesture with a fragment of wood. Both of them were 
dressed in the blue shorts, gray shirts, and red neckerchiefs ‘ 
which were the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands 
above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the 
boy’s demeanor, that it was not altogether a game. j 

“You’re a traitor!” yelled the boy. “You’re a thought-crimi- j 
nal! You’re a Eurasian spy! I'll shoot you. I’ll vaporize you, 

I’ll send you to the salt mines!” 

Suddenly they were both leaping around him, shouting j 
“Traitor!” and “Thought-criminal!”, the little girl imitating her | 
brother in every movement. It was somehow slightly frighten- i 
Inc like the gambolinu of tiger cubs which will soon grow u* | 
into man-eaters. There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the , 

20 


1 



boy’s eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a 
consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. It was 
a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston 
thought. 

Mrs. Parsons’s eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the 
children, and back again. In the better light of the living room 
he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the 
creases of her face. 

“They do get so noisy,” she said. “They’re disappointed be¬ 
cause they couldn’t go to see the hanging, that’s what it is. I’m 
too busy to take them, and Tom won’t be back from work in 
time.” 

“Why can’t we go and see the hanging?” roared the boy in 
his huge voice. 

“Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!” chanted 
the little girl, still capering round. 

Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be 
hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered. This 
happened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle. 
Children always clamored to be taken to see it. He took his 
leave of Mrs. Parsons and made for the door. But he had not 
gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back 
of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a 
red-hot wire had been jabbed into him. He spun round just in 
jUme to see Mrs. Parsons dragging her son back into the door¬ 
way while the boy pocketed a catapult. 

“Goldstein!” bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But 
what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on 
the woman’s grayish face. 

Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and 
sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. The music 
from the telescreen had stopped. Instead, a clipped military 
voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish, a description 
of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress which had just 
been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. 

With those children, he thought, that wretched woman 
must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they 
would be watching her night and day for symptoms of un¬ 
orthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What 
was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as 
the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable 
little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency what¬ 
ever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the con¬ 
trary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. 
fhe songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drill¬ 
ing with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of 

21 




Big Brother—it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All 
their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the 
State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals?; 
It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of 
their own children. And with good reason, for hardly a week 
passed in which the Times did not carry a paragraph describing 
how some eavesdropping little sneak—"child hero” was the 
phrase generally used—had overheard some compromising re¬ 
mark and denounced his parents to the Thought Police. 

The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up 
his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find some¬ 
thing more to write in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking 
of O’Brien again. 

Years ago—how long was it? Seven years it must be—he 
had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room. 
And someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed: 
"We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.” It was 
said very quietly, almost casually—a statement, not a com¬ 
mand. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious 
was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made 
much impression on him. It was only later and by degrees 
that they had seemed to take on significance. He could not 
now remember whether it was before or after having the 
dream that he had seen O'Brien for the first time; nor could 
he remember when he had first identified the voice af 
O’Brien’s. But at any rate the identification existed. It was 
O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark. 

Winston had never been able to feel sure—even after this 
morning’s flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure— 
whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it even 
seem to matter greatly. There was a link of understanding be¬ 
tween them more important than affection or partisanship. 
‘We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,” he 
had said. Winston did not know what it meant, only that in 
some way or another it would come true. 

The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, clear 
and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. The voice con¬ 
tinued raspingly: 

"Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this mo¬ 
ment arrived from the Malabar front. Our forces in South 
India have won a glorious victory. 1 am authorized to say that 
the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within 
measureablc distance of its end. Here is the newsflash— ’ 

Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, fob 
lowing on a gory description of the annihilation of a Eurasia/? 
army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came 

22 


the announcement that, as from next week, the chocolate ra¬ 
tion would be reduced from thirty grams to twenty. 

A Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off. leaving 
a deflated feeling. The telescreen—perhaps to celebrate the 
victory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate— 
crashed into “Oceania, ’tis for thee.” You were supposed to 
stand to attention. However, in his present position he was in¬ 
visible. 


"Oceania, ’tis for thee” gave way to lighter music. Winston 
walked over to the window, keeping his back to the telescreen. 
The day was still cold and clear. Somewhere far away a rocket 
bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating roar. About twenty 
or thirty of them a week were falling on London at present. 

Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and 
fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished. 
Ingsoc. The sacred principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak, double¬ 
think, the mutability of the past. He felt as though he were 
wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous 
world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The 
past was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty 
had he that a single human creature now living was on his side? . 
And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Party 
would not endure for ever? Like an answer, the three slogans 
on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back at him: 

% 

WAR IS PEACE 


FREEDOM IS SLAVERY 

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. 

He took a twenty-five-cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, 
in iny clear lettering, the same sloeans were inscribed, and 
on the other face of the coin the head of Big Brother. Even 
trom the coin the eyes pursued you. On coins, on stamps, on 
e covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the wrap- 
ping of a cigarette packet—everywhere. Always the eyes 
watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, 
working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in 
ea—-no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic 
centimeters inside your skull. 

The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the 

XonV^tP' Trut J 1 * with the light no longer shining on them, 

before t 8 h ,m 38 thG lo °P ho,cs of a fortress. His heart quailed 

codd ^ e K n0rmOUS J pyramidal sha P e - ]t was to ° strong, it 
could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not

batter it down. He wondered again for whom he was writing 
the diary. For the future, for the past—for an age that might 
be imaginary. And in front of him there lay not death but an* 
nihilation. The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to 
vapor. Only the Thought Police would read what he had writ¬ 
ten, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. 
How could you make appeal to the future when not a trace 
of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of 
paper, could physically survive? 

The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten min¬ 
utes. He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty. 

Curiously, the chiming of the hour seeming to have put 
new heart into him. He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth 
that nobody would ever hear. But so long, as he uttered it, in 
some obscure way the continuity was not broken. It was not by 
making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on 
the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, 
and w'rote: 

To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, 
when men are different from one another and do not live alone 
—to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be un¬ 
done: 

From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from 
the age of Big Brother, from the age of double think — greet¬ 
ings! C 

He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that 
it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate 
his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The conse¬ 
quences of every act are included in the act itself. He wrote: 

Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death. 

Now that he had recognized himself as a dead man it be¬ 
came important to stay alive as long as possible. Two fingers 
of his right hand were inkstained. It was exactly the kind of 
detail that might betray you. Some nosing zealot in the Ministry 
(a woman, probably; someone like the little sandy-haired 
woman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) 
might start wondering why he had been writing during the 
lunch interval, why he had used an old-fashioned pen, 
what he had been writing—and then drop a hint in the appro¬ 
priate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed 
the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped 
your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted fo&lt;! 

this purpose.

He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless to 
think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or 
xnot its existence had been discovered. A hair laid across the 
L age-ends was too obvious. With the tip of his finger he picked 
lt ip an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the 
corner of the cover, where is was bound to be shaken off if the 
book was moved.

Winston was dreaming of his mother. 

He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old 
when his mother had disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, 
rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent 
fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely as dark and 
thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered 
especially the very thin soles of his father’s shoes) and wear¬ 
ing spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been 
swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the Fifties. 

At that moment his mother was sitting in some place deep 
down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. He did 
not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, 
always silent, with large, watchful eyes. Both of them were 
looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean 
place—the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave 
*—but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself 
moving downwards. They were in the saloon of a sinking 
ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. There 
was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he 
them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into 
the green waters which in another moment must hide them 


from sight forever. He was out in the light and air while 
they were being sucked down to death, and they were down 
there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew it, 
and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no 
reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowl¬ 
edge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, 
and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things. 

He could not remember what had happened, but he knew 
in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his 
sister had been sacrificed to his own. It was one of those 
dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, 
are a continuation of one’s intellectual life, and in which one 
becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and

years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was 
no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the 
ancient time, to a time when there were still privacy, love, 
and friendship, and when the members of a family stood byi 
one another without needing to know the reason. His mothe y 
memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, 
when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and 
because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacri¬ 
ficed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and 
unalterable. Such things, he saw, could not happen today. 
Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of 
emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to 
see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at 
him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and 
still sinking. 

Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a sum¬ 
mer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the 
ground. The landscape that he was looking at recurred so 
often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether 
or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts 
he called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten 
pasture, with a foot track wandering across it and a molehill 
here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side of 
the field the boughs of the^clm trees were swaying very faintly 
in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like 
women’s hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, 
there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swim¬ 
ming in the pools under the willow trees. 

The girl with dark hair was coming toward him across the 
field. With what seemed a single movement she tore off her 
clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. Her body was 
white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him; indeed, 
he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant 
was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown 
her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessness it seemed 
to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of thought, as 
thouch Big Brother and the Party and the Ihought Police 
could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid move¬ 
ment of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the 
ancient time. Winston woke up with the word Shakespeare 

The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle 
which continued on the same note for thirty-seconds. It was 
nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers. 
Winston wrenched his body out of bed—naked, for i MV 
ber of the Outer Party received only three thousand clothing* 


coupons annually, and a suit of pajamas was six hundred 
and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying 
across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in three min¬ 
utes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent cough¬ 
ing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking 
up. It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only 
begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a scries 
of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of the 
cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching. 

“Thirty to forty group!” yapped a piercing female voice. 
“Thirty to forty group! Take your places, please. Thirties to 
forties!” 

Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon 
which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, 
dressed in tunic and gym shoes, had already appeared. 

“Arms bending and stretching!” she rapped out. “Take 
your time, by me. One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! 
Come on comrades, put a bit of life into it! One, two, three, 
four! One, two, three, four! . . 

The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of 
Winston’s mind the impression made by his dream, and the 
rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. 
As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on 
his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered 
proper during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think 
itis way backward into the dim period of his early childhood. 
It was extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the late Fifties every¬ 
thing faded. When there were no external records that you 
could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharp¬ 
ness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably 
not happened, you remembered the details of incidents without 
being able to recapture their atmosphere, and there were long 
blank periods to which you could assign nothing. Everything 
had been different then. Even the names of countries, and 
their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip one, 
for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been 
called England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly cer¬ 
tain, had always been called London. 

Winston could not definitely remember a time when his 
country had not been at war, but it was evident that there 
had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood, 
because one of his early memories was of an air raid which 
appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the 
time when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did 
{tot remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father’s 
hand clutching his own as they hurried down, down, down 

27 


into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral 
staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so 
wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had tp 
stop and rest. His mother, in her slow dreamy way, was fol¬ 
lowing a long way behind them. She was carrying his baby 
sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she 
was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been 
born then. Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded 
place which he had realized to be a Tube station. 

There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, 
and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on 
metal bunks, one above the other. Winston and his mother 
and father found themselves a place on the floor, and near 
them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side 
on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a 
black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair; his face was 
scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. He reeked 
of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, 
and one could have fancied that the others welling from 
his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was also 
suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In 
his childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing, 
something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be 
remedied, had just happened. It also seemed to him that he 
knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved, a little 
granddaughter perhaps, had been killed. Every few minute 

the old man kept repeating: ' 

“We didn't ought to ’ave trusted ’em. I said so, Ma, didn t 
I? That’s what come of trusting 'em. 1 said so all along. We 

didn't ought to 'ave trusted the buggers.” 

But which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted Win¬ 


ston could not now remember. 

Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, 

thouiih strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. 
For “several months during his childhood there had been 
confused street fighting in London itself some of which he 
remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole 
period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, 
would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, 
and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alig - 
ment than the existing one. At this moment, for example, in 
1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and 

28 


with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely 
a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess 
A because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Of¬ 
ficially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania 
was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been 
at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always repre¬ 
sented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future 
agreement with him was impossible. 

The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth 
time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward (with 
hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies from the waist, 
an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles) 
—the frightening thing was that it might all be true. If the 
Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or 
that event, it never happened —that, surely, was more terrify¬ 
ing than mere torture and death. 

The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance 
with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had 
been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years 
ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own 
consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. 
And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed— 
if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into his¬ 
tory and became ttuth. “Who controls the past," ran the Party 
slogan, “controls the future: who controls the present con¬ 
trols the past.” And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, 
never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from 
everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was 
needed was an unending series of victories over your own 
memory. “Reality control,” they called it; in Ncwspeak, 
“doublethink.” 

“Stand easy!" barked the instructress, a little more genially. 

Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his 
lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world 
of doubtethink. To know and not to know, to be conscious 
of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed 
lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, 
knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of 
them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while 
laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible 
and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget, 
whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into 
memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then 
promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same 
i Process to the process itself—that was the ultimate subtlety: 
consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, 

29 


to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just 
performed. Even to understand the word “doublethink” in¬ 
volved the use of doublethink. £ 

The instructress had called them to attention again. “And 
now let’s see which of us can touch our toes!” she said en¬ 
thusiastically. Right over from the hips, please, comrades. 
One- two! One-two! . . .” 

Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all 
the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by 
bringing on another coughing fit. The half-pleasant quality 
went out of his meditations. The past, he reflected, had not 
merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For how 
could you establish even the most obvious fact when there 
existed no record outside your own memory? He tried to re¬ 
member in what year he had first heard mention of Big 
Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the 
Sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party his¬ 
tories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian 
of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had 
been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they 
extended into the fabulous world of the Forties and the 
Thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats 
still rode through the streets of London in great gleaming 
motor cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was no 
knowing how much of this legend was true and how much K 
invented. Winston could not even remember at what date the 
Party itself had come into existence. He did not believe he 
had ever heard the word Ingsoc before 1960, but it was pos¬ 
sible that in its Oldspeak form—“English Socialism,” that is 
to say—it had been current earlier. Everything melted into 
mist. Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a 
definite lie. It was not true, for example, as was claimed in the 
Party history books, that the Party had invented airplanes. 
He remembered airplanes since his earliest childhood. But 
you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just 
once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable 
documentary proof of the falsification of a historical fact. And 
on that occasion— 

“Smith!” screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. 
“6079 Smith W! Yes, you! Bend lower, please! You can do 
better than that. You’re not trying. Lower, please! That’s bet¬ 
ter, comrade. Now stand at case, the whole squad, and watch 

IDg.” 

A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston’s body. 
His face remained completely inscrutable. Never show dis- f 
may! Never show resentment! A single flicker of the eyes 

30 



could give you away. He stood watching while the instructress 
raised her arms above her head and—-one could not say grace¬ 
fully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency—bent over 
and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes. 

“There, comrades! that’s how I want to see you doing it. 
Watch me again. I’m thirty-nine and I've had four children. 
Now look.” She bent over again, “you see my knees aren't 
bent. You can all do it if you want to,” she added as she 
straightened herself up. “Anyone under forty-five is perfectly 
capable of touching his toes. We don't all have the privilege 
of fighting in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. 
Remember our boys on the Malabar front! And the sailors in 
the Floating Fortresses! Just think what they have to put up 
with. Now try again. That’s better, comrade, that’s much bet¬ 
ter,’ she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violent lunge, 
succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first 
time in several years. 


IV 

With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the near¬ 
ness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when 
his day’s work started, Winston pulled the speakwrite toward 
him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece, and put on his 
spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped together four small 
cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the 
pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk. 

In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the 
right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written 
messages; to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the 
side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong 
slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal 
of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of 
thousands throughout the building, not only in every room 
but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they 
were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any 
document was due for destruction, or even when one saw 
a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action 
to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in 
vvhereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm 

air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere 
in the recesses of the building. 

i-oi^ n p?K exam : ned ? e four slips of paper which he had un - 
theahlwpv c ® n | amed a message of only one or two lines, in 
the abbreviated jargon—not actually Newspeak, but consist- 

31 


ing largely of Newspeak words—which was used in the Min¬ 
istry for internal purposes. They ran: ^

times 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify 
times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs 
unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling. 

With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth 
message aside. It was an intricate and responsible job and had 
better be dealt with last. The other three were routine mat¬ 
ters, though the second one would probably mean some tedious 
wading through lists of figures. 

Winston dialed “back numbers” on the telescreen and 
called for the appropriate issues of the Times, which slid out 
of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes’ delay. The 
messages he had received referred to articles or news items 
which for one reason or another it was thought necessary 
to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For ex¬ 
ample, it appeared from the Times of the seventeenth of 
March that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous day, 
had predicted that the South Indian front would remain quiet 
but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in 
North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Com* 
mand had launched its offensive in South India and left 
North Africa alone. It waf. therefore necessary to rewrite a 
paragraph of Big Brother’s speech in such a way as to make 
him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or again, 
the Times of the nineteenth of December had published the 
official forecasts of the output of various classes of consump¬ 
tion goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the 
sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. Today’s issue 
contained a statement of the actual output, from which it 
appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly 
wrong. Winston’s job was to rectify the original figures by 
making them agree with the later ones. As for the third mes¬ 
sage, it referred to a very simple error which could be set 
right in a couple of minutes. As short a time ago as February, 
the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a “categorical 
pledge” were the official words) that there would be no re¬ 
duction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as 
Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced 
from thirty grams to twenty at the end of the present week. Air 
that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a 

32 


warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ra- 
tion at some time in April. 

As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, 
he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate 
copy of the limes and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. 
Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible un¬ 
conscious, he crumpled up the original message and any 
notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the 
memory hole to be devoured by the flames. ’ 

What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the 
pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did 
know in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which 
happened to be necessary in any particular number of the 
rimes had been assembled and collated, that number would be 
reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy 
p aced on the files in its stead, this process of continuous 
alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, 
periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound tracks 
cartoons, photographs—to every kind of literature or docu¬ 
mentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideo¬ 
logical significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute

But actually, he thought as he readjusted the Ministry of 
Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the ^ 
substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the* 
material that you were dealing with had no connection with 
anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that 
is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fan¬ 
tasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A 
great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out 
of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast 
had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at a hundred 
and forty-five million pairs. The actual output was given as 
sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the fore¬ 
cast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to 
allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfilled. 

In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than 
fifty-seven millions, or than a hundred and forty-five millions. 
Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, 
nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. 
All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of 
boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the popu¬ 
lation of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every 
class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away 
into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the 
year had become uncertain. 

Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding* 
cubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned 
man named Tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded 
newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouth¬ 
piece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep what 
he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. 
He looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in 


Winston's direction. 

Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work 
he was employed on. People in the Records Department did 
not readily talk about their jobs. In the long, windowless hall, 
with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers 
and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were 
quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by 
name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the 
corridors or gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew 
that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy 
hair toiled day in, day out, simply at tracking down and de¬ 
leting from the press the names of people who had been 
vaporized and were therefore considered never to have ex- ( 
isted. There was a certain fitness in this, since her own hus*,. 
band had been vaporized a couple of years earlier. And a Jew 



cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named 
Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for 
Ajuggling with rhymes and meters, was engaged in producing 
garbled versions—definitive texts, they were called—of poems 
which had become ideologically offensive but which for one 
reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies. And 
this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one 
sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of 
the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other 
swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of 
jobs. There were the huge printing shops with their sub¬ 
editors, their typography experts, and their elaborately 
equipped studios for the faking of photographs. There was the 
teleprograms section with its engineers, its producers, and its 
teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating 
voices. There were the armies of reference clerks whose job 
was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which 
were due for recall. There were the vast repositories where 
the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden fur¬ 
naces where the original copies were destroyed. And somehow 
or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains 
who coordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of 
policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past 
should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed 
out of existence. 


* . A , nd the Records Department, after all, was itself only a 
single branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was 
not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of 
Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen pro¬ 
grams, plays, novels—with every conceivable kind of infor¬ 
mation, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a 

S °.? an ’ a , y r,c P° em to a biological treatise, and from a 

chffd s spelling book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Min- 
istry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the 
t'arty, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level 
tor the benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole chain 
o separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, 
music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were pro- 
duced rubbishy newspapers, containing almost nothing except 
2° rcnme ’ “ d astrology, sensational five-ccnt novelettes, 
ooTed P°n»- nS i W !! h SCX ’ u and sen tiniental songs which were com- 
dosenne t ire y Y mcchan,caI m eans on a special kind of kalei- 

„ seluon k ;„° Wn " a VCrSiflCator - Th ^ was even a whole sub- 
^section --Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak_enoAooH in 

^pro ucing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out 



in sealed packets and which no Party member, other than 
those who worked on it, was permitted to look at. 

Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube white* 
Winston was working; but they were simple matters, and he 
had disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate inter¬ 
rupted him. When the Hate was over he returned to his cubicle, 
took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the 
speak write to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down 
to his main job of the morning. 

Winston’s greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most of 
it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also 
jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in 
them as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicate 
pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you ex¬ 
cept your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your 
estimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was 
good at this kind of thing. On occasion he had even been en¬ 
trusted with the rectification of the Times leading articles, 
which were written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolled the 
message that he had set aside earlier. It ran: 

times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs 
unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling. 

In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered: 

A 

The reporting of Big Brother’s Order for the Day in the 
Times of December 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and 
makes references to nonexistent persons. Rewrite it in full 
and submit your draft to higher authority before filing. 

Winston read through the offending article. Big Brother’s 
Order for the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to 
praising the work of an organization known as FFCC, which 
supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the 
Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a prominent 
member of the Inner Party, had been singled out for special 
mention and awarded a decoration, the Order of Conspicuous 
Merit, Second Class. 

Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with 
no reasons given. One could assume that Withers and his as¬ 
sociates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report 
of the matter in the press or on the telescreen. That was to be 
expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be 
put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges in¬ 
volving thousands of people, with public trails of traitors and. 
thought-criminals who made abject confession of their crimes

and were afterwards executed, were special showpieces not 
occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. More com- 
*• monly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party 
» simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never 
i had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In 
some cases they might not even be dead. Perhaps thirty peo- 
? pie personally known to Winston, not counting his parents, had 
disappeared at one time or another. 

Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper clip. In the 
cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching 
, secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head for a mo- 
&gt;' ment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. Winston wondered 
whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same job as 
himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece of work 
would never be entrusted to a single person; on the other 
hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly 
that an act of fabrication was taking place. Very likely as 
many as a dozen people were now working away on rival 
versions of what Big Brother had actually said. And presently 
some master brain in the Inner Party would select this version 
or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex pro¬ 
cesses of cross-referencing that would be required, and then 
1 the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and be¬ 
come truth. 

Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. 
Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big 
Brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate. 
Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been suspected 
of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps—what was likeliest of all 
-—thing had simply happened because purges and vapor¬ 
izations were a necessary part of the mechanics of govern- 
me nf- The only real clue lay in the words “refs unpersons,” 
which indicated that Withers was already dead. You could 
not invariably assume this to be the case when people were 
arrested. Sometimes they were released and allowed to re¬ 
main at liberty for as much as a year or two years before 
being executed. Very occasionally some persons whom you 
had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappear¬ 
ance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds 
of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time forever. 
Withers, however, was already an unperson. He did not exist; 
he had never existed. Winston decided that it would not be 
enough simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother's speech. 
It was better to make it deal with something totally uncon¬ 
nected with its original subject. 

He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of 

37 


traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, 
while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of over¬ 
production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan, might complicated 
the records too much. What was needed was a piece of pure 
fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready-made as 
it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had 
recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were 
occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order for the Day 
to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file Party member 
whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be 
followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. 

It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, 
but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs 
would soon bring him into existence. 

Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite 
toward him and began dictating in Big Brother's familiar 
style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a 
trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them 
(“What lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades? The 
lessons—which is also one of the fundamental principles of 
Ingsoc—that,” etc., etc.), easy to imitate. 

At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys 
except a drum, a submachine gun, and a model helicopter. At 
six—a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules—he had 
joined the Spies; at nine he had been a troop leader. At eleven 
he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police after over-* 
hearing a conversation which appeared to him to have crim¬ 
inal tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer 
of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed 
a hand grenade which had been adopted by the Ministry of 
Peace and which, at its first trial, had killed thirty-one Eurasian 
prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he had perished in 
action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the 
Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his 
body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter 
into deep water, despatches and all—an end, said Big Brother, 
which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of 
envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity and 
singlemindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life. He was a total 
abstainer and a nonsmokcr, had no recreations except a daily 
hour in the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, be¬ 
lieving marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible 
with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty. He had no 
subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, an&lt;L 
no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy an(T 

38 



the hunting-down of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and 
traitors generally. 

Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade 
Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit; and in the end he 
decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referenc¬ 
ing that it would entail. 

Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. 
Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson 
was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of 
knowing whose version would finally be adopted, but he felt 
a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade 
Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck 
him as curious that you could create dead men but not living 
ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, 
now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery 
was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon 
the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.

In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep under ground, the lunch 
queue jerked slowly forward. The room was already very 
full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the counter the 
steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell 
*vhich did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On 
the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole 

in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large 
nip. 

“Just the man I was looking for,” said a voice at Winston's 
back. 

He turned round. It was his friend Syrne, who worked in 
the Research Department. Perhaps “friend” was not exactly 
the right word. You did not have friends nowadays, you had 
comrades; but there were some comrades whose society was 
pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a spe¬ 
cialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous team 
°u C3 S ertS D0W en 2 a S ed in compiling the Eleventh Edition of 
l „, WS P )ea k dictionary. He was a tiny creature, smaller 
than Winston, with dark hair and large, protuberant eyes, at 
once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search your 
face closely while he was speaking to you. 

he said^ antCd t0 ^ y ° U whcther you d 8 ot any razor blades,” 


jl. j °} one - said w »nston with a sort of guilty haste. “Eve 
Uned all over the place. They don't exist any longer.” 

Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he 



had two unused ones which he was hoarding up. There had 
been a famine of them for months past. At any given mo¬ 
ment there was some necessary article which the Party shop/ 
were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes 
it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present 
it was razor blades. You could only get hold of them, if at all, 
by scrounging more or less furtively on the “free” market. 

“I've been using the same blade for six weeks,” he added 
untruthfully. 

The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he 
turned and faced Syme again. Each of them took a greasy 
metal tray from a pile at the edge of the counter. 

"Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?” said 
Syme. 

“I was working,” said Winston indifferently. “I shall see it 
on the flicks, I suppose.” 

“A very inadequate substitute,” said Syme. 

His mocking eyes roved over Winston’s face. “I know you,” 
the eyes seemed to say, “I see through you, I know very well 
why you didn't go to see those prisoners hanged.” In an 
intellectual way, Syme was venomously orthodox. He would 
talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter 
raids on enemy villages, the trial and confessions of thought- 
criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of 
Love. Talking to him was largely a matter of getting hin^ 
away from such subjects and entangling him, if possible, in 
the technicalities of Ncwspcak, on which he was authoritative 
and interesting. Winston turned his head a little aside to avoid 

the scrutiny of the large dark eyes. 

“It was a good hanging,” said Syme reminiscently. “I think 
it spoils it when they tie their feet together. I like to see them 
kicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right 
out, and blue—a quite bright blue. That’s the detail that ap¬ 
peals to me.” 

"Nex\ please!” yelled the white-aproned proe with the ladle. 

Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. 
Onto each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch—metal 
pannikin, of pinkish-gray stew, a hunk of bread, a cube ot 
cheese a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and one saccharin. 


“There’s a table over there, under that telescreen, said 

Svme. “Let’s pick up a gin on the way.” , 

' The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. 
They threaded their way across the crowded room and un¬ 
packed their trays onto the metal-topped table, on one cor¬ 
ner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthy liquid 

40 


mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his 
mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and 
gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the 
tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was 
hungry. He began swallowing spoonsfuls of the stew, which, 
in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish 
stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of 
them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From 
the table at Winston’s left, a little behind his back, someone 
was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble almost 
like the quacking of a duck, which pierced the general uproar 
of the room. 

“How is the dictionary getting on?” said Winston, raising 
his voice to overcome the noise. 

“Slowly,” said Syme. I’m on the adjectives. It’s fascinating.” 

He had brightened up immediately at the mention of 
Newspeak. He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk 
of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other, 
and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without 
shouting. 

“The E,e . venth Edition is the definitive edition,” he said. 
“We’re getting the language into its final shape—the shape it’s 
going to have when nobody speaks anything else. When we’ve 
finished with it, people like you will have to learn it all over 
*■ again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing 
new words. But not a bit of it! We’re destroying words—scores 
of them, hundreds of them, every day. We’re cutting the 
language down to the bone. The Eleventh Edition won’t con- 

'ulsn 3 ” 5 ' 118 * 6 Word l ^ at wd * become obsolete before the year 

V/ J U ■ 


He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of 
mouthfuls then continued speaking, with a sort of pedant’s 
passion. His thin dark face had become animated, his eyes 
had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy. 
Its a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course

good’ covers the meaning, or ‘doubleplusgood* if you want 
something stronger still. Of course we use those forms al- 
ready, but in the final version of Newspeak there’ll be nothing 
else, in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness 
will be covered by only six words—in reality, only one word. 
Don’t you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was B.B. s idea 
originally, of course,” he added as an afterthought. 

A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston s face at the 
mention of Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately de¬ 
tected a certain lack of enthusiasm. M 

“You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston, 
he said almost sadly. “Even when you write it you’re still 
thinking in Oldspeak. I’ve read some of those pieces that you 
write in the Times occasionally. They're good enough but 
they’re translations. In your heart you’d prefer to stick to 
Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of 
meaning. You don’t grasp the beauty of the destruction of 
words. Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in 
the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?” 

Winston did know that, of course. He smi ed sympatheti¬ 
cally he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off 
another fragment of the dark-colored bread, chewed it briefly, 


and went on: , . .__ 

“Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to n r- 

row the range of thought? In the end we shall make thought-,* 

crime literally impossible, because there will be no_ words in 

which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed 

will be expressed by exacty one word, w.th its meaning’"8^ 

defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out andto 

gotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we re not far from 

fhat point. But the process will still be continuing long after 

you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words .and 

the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, 

of course there’s no reason or excuse for committing tnou ht- 

crime It s merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control. 

But in the end there won't be any need even for . ,hal ' ™ 

Revolution will be complete when the language P« rfect ' 

Newspeak" is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak," he added with 

a sort of mystical satisfaction. “Has it ever occurred to you 

Winston that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single 

human being will be alive who could understand such a con- 

Ve “Ex«pt—'^be a g r rn h Wins1on°doubtfully, and then stopped 
if had been on the tip of his tongue to say "Except ther 
proles*!" but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain th 



this remark was not in some way unorthodox. Syme, however, 
^iaa divined what he was about to say. 

The proles are not human beings,” he said carelessly. ‘‘By 
2050—earlier, probably—all real knowledge of Oldspeak wHI 
have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will have 
been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron—they’ll 
exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into 
something different, but actually changed into something con¬ 
tradictory of what they used to be. Even the literature of the 
I arty will change. Even the slogans will change. How could 
you have a slogan like ‘freedom is slavery’ when the concept

will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we under- 

, s ' and no u w - ° r,hod oxy means not thinking—not needing to

One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep con¬ 
viction, Syme will be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees 
too clearly and speaks too plainly. The Party does not like

mending sterner measures against thought-criminals and sabo¬ 
teurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the 
Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroe^ 
on the Malabar front—it made no difference. Whatever it was, 
you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, 
pure Ingsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw mov¬ 
ing rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that 
this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. It 
was not the man’s brain that was speaking; it was his larynx. 
The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but 
it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in 
unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck. 

Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle 
of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The 
voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible 
in spite of the surrounding din. 

“There is a word in Newspeak," said Syme. "I don t know 
whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. It is 
one of those interesting words that have two contradictory 
meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse; applied to 
someone you agree with, it is praise.” 

Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought 
again. He thought it with a kind of sadness, although well 
knowing that Syme despised him and slightly disliked him, 
and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal 
if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly 
wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: dis¬ 
cretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not 
say that he was unorthodox. He believed in the principles or 
Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he rejoiced over victories, 
he hated heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of 
restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of information, which the 
ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint air of 
disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would 
have been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he fre¬ 
quented the Chestnut Tree Cafe, haunt of painters and musi¬ 
cians There was no law, not even an unwritten law, against 
frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the place was some¬ 
how ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had 
been used to gather there before they were finally purged. 
Goldstein himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there, 
years and decades ago. Syme's fate was not difficult to foresee. 
And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three 
seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secret opinions, X* 
would betray him instantly to the Thought Police. So wotfld 

44 



anybody else, for that matter, but Syme more than most. Zeal 
was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness. 
a Syme looked up. “Here comes Parsons,” he said. 

Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, “that 
bloody fool.” Parsons, Winston's fellow tenant at Victory 
Mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room—a 
tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face. 
At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck 
and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His 
whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so 
much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, 
it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed 
in the blue shorts, gray shirt, and red neckerchief of the Spies. 
In visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees 
and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did, in¬ 
deed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any 
other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He 
greeted them both with a cheery “Hullo, hullo!” and sat down 
at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat. Beads of 
moisture stood out all over his pink face. His powers of sweat¬ 
ing were extraordinary. At the Community Center you could 
always tell when he had been playing table tennis by the damp- 
ness of the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper 
on which there was a long column of words, and was studying 
it with an ink pencil between his fingers.

“I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,** 
said Winston. 

"Ah, well—what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, t- 
doesn’t it? Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, 
but talk about keenness! All they think about is the Spies, and 
the war, of course. D’you know what that little girl of mine 
did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike out Berk- 
hampstead way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped 
off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a 
strange man. They kept on his tail for two hours, right through 
the woods, and then, when they got into Amersham, handed 
him over to the patrols.” 

"What did they do that for?” said Winston, somewhat 
taken aback. Parsons went on triumphantly: 

"My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent— 
might have been dropped by parachute, for instance. But 
here’s the point, old boy. What do you think put her onto him 
in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a funny kind of 
shoes—said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that 
before. So the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart 
for a nipper of seven, eh?” 

"What happened to the man?” said Winston. 

"Ah, that I couldn’t say, of course. But I wouldn’t be alto¬ 
gether surprised if—” Parsons made the motion of aiming a 
rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion. 

“Good,” said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from 
his strip of paper. 

"Of course we can't afford to take chances,” agreed Win¬ 


ston dutifully. 

w 

"What I mean to say, there is a war on,” said Parsons. 

As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated 
from the telescreen just above their heads. However, it was 
not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but mere¬ 
ly an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. 

"Comrades!” cried an eager youthful voice. "Attention, 
comrades! We have glorious news for you. We have won the 
battle for production! Returns now completed of the output 
of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard 
of living has risen by no less than twenty per cent over the 
past year. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressi¬ 
ble spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out 
of factories and offices and paraded through the streets with 
banners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new, 
happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us. 
Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs— • 

The phrase "our new, happy life recurred several times. It 

46 


had been a favorite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Par¬ 
sons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening 
•^vith a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. He 
could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were 
in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged out a 
huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred 
tobacco. With the tobacco ration at a hundred grams a week 
it was seldom possible to fill a pipe up to the top. Winston was 
smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizon¬ 
tal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only 
(our cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to 
the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed 
out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had even been 
demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate 
ration to twenty grams a week. And only yesterday, he re¬ 
flected, it had been announced that the ration was to be 
reduced to twenty grams a week. Was it possible that thev 
could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, thev 
swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupiditv 
o. an animal. The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed 
' fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track 
down denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest 
that last week the ration had been thirty grams. Syme, too—

L , eak °; 11 out ,nto a pattern. He meditated resentfullv 
on the physical texture of life. Had it always been 1 ke his? 

Had food always tasted like this? He looked around the can 

,0 'y'? ei,ln S ed - crowded room, its walls grimy from the 
contact of innumerable bodies; battered mefal tables and

that you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories 
of anything greatly different. In any time that he could ac¬ 
curately remember, there had never been quite enough to eat,*, 
one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of 
holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms 
underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, 
bread dark-colored, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes 
insufficient—nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. 
And though, of course, it grew worse as one’s body aged, was 
it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things, if 
one’s heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, 
the interminable winters, the stickiness of one's socks, the lifts 
that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the ciga¬ 
rettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes? 
Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some 
kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different? 

He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was 
ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed other¬ 
wise than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of the 
room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like 
man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspi¬ 
cious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought 
Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the 
physical type set up by the Party as an ideal—tall muscular 
youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sun¬ 
burnt, carefree—existed and even predominated. Actually, s« 
far as he could judge, the majority of people in Airstrip One 
were small, dark, and ill-favored. It was curious how that 
beetlelike type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy 
men, growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift 
scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small 
eyes. It was the type that seemed to flourish best under the 
dominion of the Party. 

The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on 
another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, 
stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, 

took his pipe out of his mouth. 

‘The Ministry of Plenty’s certainly done a good job this 
year,” he said with a knowing shake of his head. "By the way, 
Smith old boy, I suppose you haven’t got any razor blades 
you can let me have?” 

“Not one,” said Winston. ‘Tve been using the same blade 

for six weeks myself.” M 

“Ah, well—just thought I'd ask you, old boy. 

“Sorry,” said Winston. Y. 

The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily 6 

48 


lenced during the Ministry’s announcement, had started up 
again, as loud as ever. For some reason Winston suddenly 
found himself thinking of Mrs. Parsons, with her wispy hair 
and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those 
(children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. 
Mrs. Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. 
Winston would be vaporized. O'Brien would be vaporized. 
Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized. The 
eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be va¬ 
porized. The little beetlelike men who scutted so nimbly 
through the labyrinthine corridors of Ministries—they, too, 
would never be vaporized. And the girl with dark hair, the 
girl from the Fiction Department—she would never be va¬ 
porized either. It seemed to him that he knew instinctively 
who would survive and who would perish, though just what it 
was that made for survival, it was not easy to say. 

At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a 
violent jerk. The girl at the next table had turned partly round 
and was looking at him. It was the girl with dark hair. She 
was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious inten¬ 
sity. The instant that she caught his eye she looked away 


again. 

The sweat started out on Winston’s backbone. A horrible 
.T-pang of terror went through him. It was gone almost at once, 
but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. Why was she 
watching him? Why did she keep following him about? Un¬ 
fortunately he could not remember whether she had already 
been at that table when he arrived, or had come there after¬ 


wards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two Minutes 
Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was 
no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had 
been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting 
loudly enough. 

His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not 
actually a member of the Thought Police, but then it was 
precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all. 
He did not know how long she had been looking at him, but 

j minutes, and it was possible that 

•ui C j tUreS not been perfectly under control. It was ter¬ 
ribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were 
in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The small¬ 
est thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious 

X* ° f a ™ e *.y L a h ^ blt of muttering to yourself—anything 
£hat carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having 
something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expres¬ 
sion on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was 


49 


announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. 
There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it wa§# 
called. 

The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after 
all she was not really following him about; perhaps it was 
coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days run¬ 
ning. His cigarette had gone out. and he laid it carefully on 
the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work, 
if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at 
the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite 
likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love 
within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. 
Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in 
his pocket. Parsons had begun talking again. 

“Did 1 ever tell you, old boy,’" he said, chuckling round the 
stem of his pipe, “about the time when those two nippers of 
mine set fire to the old market-woman's skirt because they 
saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of B.B.? Sneaked up 
behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches. Burned 
her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But keen as 
mustard! That’s a first-rate training they give them in the 
Spies nowadays—better than in my day, even. What d'you 
think’s the latest thing they've served them out with? Ear 
trumpets for listening through keyholes! My little girl brought 
one home the other night—tried it out on our sitting roortf 
door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her 
ear to the hole. Of course it’s only a toy, mind you. Still, gives 
’em the right idea, eh?” 

At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. It 
was the signal to return to work. All three men sprang to their 
feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining 
tobacco fell out of Winston’s cigarette. 


VI 

Winston was writing in his diary: 

It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a nar¬ 
row side street near one of the big railway stations. She was 
standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that 
hardly gave any light. She had a young face, painted very 
thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the white¬ 
ness of it. like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party womejs 
never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the siren, 
and no telescreens. She said two dollars. / 

50 



For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his 
M eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze 
out the vision that kept recurring. He had an almost over¬ 
whelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the 
top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick 
over the table and hurl the inkpot through the window—to do 
any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the 
memory that was tormenting him. 

Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous 
system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to 
translate itself into some visible symptom. He thought of a 
man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back: a 
quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five 
or forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief case. They were a 
few meters apart when the left side of the man's face was 
suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happened again 
just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a 
quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but ob¬ 
viously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: that 
poor devil is done for. And what was frightening was that the 
action was quite possibly unconscious. The most deadly dan¬ 
ger of all was talking in your sleep. There was no way of 
guarding against that, so far as he could see. 

He drew in his breath and went on writing: 

* 

I went with her through the doorway and across a hack- 
yard into a basement kitchen. There was a bed against the 
wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low . She _ 


His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. 

fhTJh a , n Tv y r h th l Woman in the basement kitchen he 
thought of Katharine, h.s wife. Winston was married—had 

at t ny ra / e; probabI y he stil1 was married, for 
S ° far as he knew h, s wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe 
again the warm stuffy odor of the basement kitchen, an odor 
compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap 
scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of ffie 

On?v y the e nrni SCd ° r C ° uld be ima S'ned as doing so. 

Only the proles used scent. In his mind the smell of it was 

,ne * ricably mixed up with fornication.

camp: not more, if you had committed no other offense. And 
it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being* 
caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women 
who were ready to sell themselves. Some could even be pur¬ 
chased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed 
to drink. Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage 
prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be alto¬ 
gether suppressed. Mere debauchery did not matter very 
much so long as it was furtive and joyless, and only involved 
the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgiv¬ 
able crime was promiscuity between Party members. Bu 
though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the 
-reat purges invariably confessed to—it was difficult to imag- 

fne anv such thine actually happening. 

The aim of the Party was not merely to P reven tjnen and 
women from forming loyalties which it might uotbeableto 
control Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove a 1 pleas 
ureTom the sexual act. Not love so much as eroticism w 
the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All 
between Party members had to be approved by a committee 
appointed for the purpose, and-though the pnnaple was 
never clearlv stated-permission was always refused if the 
coudIc concerned gave the impression of being physically 
tracted Tone anofher. The o\ recognized P-pose of ma, 
riaoe was to becet children for the service of the Party. 5&gt;exua 
intercourse was' to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor 
operation, like having £ 

every 5 Party'°member "om chddhood oltwards There were 
even organizations such as the Junior An.i-.Se, Leaguc wh ch 
advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. All children were 
to be begotten by artificial insemination {arisen it was called 
n Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This 
Winston was aware, was no. mean, altogether seriously, but 
somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. 
The P irtv was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could n 
^lined then ^distort it and dirty it. He did no, know why 
this was so, but it seemed natural that ,1sboM beso. A 
far as the women were concerned, the Party s eitons

Ho thought again of rvatnarinc. 11 iiium u

mit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases 
A where there were no children. 

Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with 
splendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face 
that one might have called noble until one discovered that 
there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. Vers early 
in their married life he had decided—though perhaps it was 
only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most 
people that she had without exception the most stupid, vul¬ 
gar, empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had not 
a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no 
imbecility, absolutely none, that she was not capable of 
swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. “The human 
sound track he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could 

have endured living with her if it had not been for just one 
thing—sex. 

To A em S hrTr,f S hl! e touc ^ d her she seemed to wince and stiffen. 

And * h Was ,ke ernbrac,n S a jointed wooden image. 
And what was strange was that even when she was clasping

pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity of her

wards they parted. ^ lVe U{5 trying ’ an d soon after- 

w Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and 


heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that 
moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharine s white,, 
body, frozen forever by the hypnotic power of the Party. Why 
did it always have to be like this? Why could he not have a 
woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals 
of years? But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable 
event. The women of the Party were all alike. Chastity was as 
deeply ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By careful early 
conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that 
was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the 
Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and mar¬ 
tial music,'the natural feeling had been driven out of them. 
His reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his 
heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable, as the 
Party intended that they should be. And what he wanted, 
more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall ot 
virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life. The sexual 
act, successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire was nought- 
crime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if he c ° uld ha ^ 
achieved it. would have been like a seduction, although she 

was his wife. . 

But the rest of the story had got to be written down. H 

wrote: 


/ turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light 

After the darkness, the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had 
seemed very bright. For the first time he could see the woman 
properly. He had taken a step toward her and then halted, 
full of lust and terror. He was painfully conscious of the 

he had taken in coming here. It was P erf ^y P f' J r

He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had 
written it down at last, but it made no difference. The therapy 
had not worked. The urge to shout filthy words at the top of 
his voice was as strong as ever. 


VII 


If there is hope [wrote Winston] it lies in the proles. 


If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only 
there, in those swarming disregarded masses, eighty-five per 
cent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy 
the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be over¬ 
thrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had 
no way of coming together or even of identifying one an¬ 
other. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just pos¬ 
sibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could 
ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebel¬ 
lion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice; at 
the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if 
only they could somehow become conscious of their own 
strength, would have no need to conspire. They needed only 
to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking ofT flics. 
If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow 
-•morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it 
And yet—! 


He remembered how once he had been walking down a 
crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices 
—women s voices had burst from a side street a little way 
ahead It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a 
deep loud Oh-o-o-o-oh!” that went humminc on like the 
reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It’s started! he 
had thought A not! The proles are breaking loose at last! 
YVhen he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or 
three hundred women-crowding around the stalls of a street 
market with faces as tragic as though they had been the 

°? e , d f aSSenSe u rS ? n a ., sinkin * shi P- B “t at this moment the 
general despair broke down into a multitude of individual 

quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling 

: S S nS&gt; h , ey r ere wretchcd * fli ™sy things, but cook¬ 
ing pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the 

supply had unexpectedly given out. The successful women 

bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with 

aheir saucepans while dozens of others clamored round the 

c CCUSinS thc s,a,llcee P cr Of favoritism and of bavin™ 
more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh out- 




burst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair 
coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were 
trying to tear it out of one another's hands. For a moment * 
they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. Winston 
watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what 
almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only 
a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never 
shout like that about anything that mattered? 

He wrote: 

conscious they will never rebel, and 
until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious. 

That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription 
from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, 
to have liberated the proles from bondage. Before the Revolu¬ 
tion they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists, 
they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced 
to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal 
mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the 
factories at the age of six. But simultaneously, true to the 
principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the proles 
were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like 
animals, by the application of a few simple rules. In reality 
very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to*- 
know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, 
their other activities were without importance. Left to them¬ 
selves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, 
they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural 
to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were born, they 
grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they 
passed through a brief blossoming period of beauty and sexual 
desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-age at thirty, 
they died, for the most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, 
the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbors, 
films, football, beer, and, above all, gambling filled up the 
horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not diffi¬ 
cult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among 
them, spreading false rumors and marking down and eliminat¬ 
ing the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming 
dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them 
with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable that the 
proles should have strong political feelings. All that was re¬ 
quired of them was a primitive patriotism which could be ap*^ 
pealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept^ 
longer working hours or shorter rations. And even when they 

56 


became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent 
--led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could 
only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils 
invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles 
did not even have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil 
police interfered with them very little. There was a vast 
amount of criminality in London, a whole world-within-a- 
world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug peddlers, and 
racketeers of every description; but since it all happened 
among the proles themselves, it was of no importance. In all 
questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ances¬ 
tral code. The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed 
upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished; divorce was per¬ 
mitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have 
been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing 
or wanting it. They were beneath suspicion. As the Party 
slogan put it: “Proles and anixnals are free.” 

Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his vari¬ 
cose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing you invari¬ 
ably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life 
before the Revolution had really been like. He took out of 
the drawer a copy of a children’s history textbook which he 
had borrowed from Mrs. Parsons, and began copying a pas¬ 
sage into the diary: 

In the old days {it ran], before the glorious Revolution, 
London was not the beautiful city that we know today. It 
nv7.9 a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had 
enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor 
people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep 
under. Children no older than you are had to work twelve 
hours a day for cruel masters, who flogged them with whips 
if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale 
brcadcrusts and water. But in among all this terrible poverty 
there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived 
m by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look 
after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They were 
fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on 
the opposite page. You can see that he is dressed in a long 
black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny 
hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat This 
was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was al¬ 
lowed to wear it. 7 he capitalists owned everything in the 

&amp;°nd'nn n t e T y0ne d n V™ ' Aw&gt; slave - Thc &gt;' the 

U\nd, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money If 

anyone disobeyed them they could throw him into prison, or 

57 


they could take his job away and starve him to death. When 
any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and 
bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as “Sir 
The chief of all the capitalists was called the King, and — 

But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be 
mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in 
their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the 
cat-o’-nine-tails, the Lord Mayor’s Banquet, and the practice 
of kissing the Pope’s toe. There was also something called the 
ins primae noctis, whic+i would probably not be mentioned in 
a textbook for children. It was the law by which every capi¬ 
talist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one 
of his factories. 

How could you tell how much of it was lies? It might b$ 
true that the average human being was better off now than 
he had been before the Revolution. The only evidence to the 
contrary was the mute protest* in your own bones, the in- 
stinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intoler¬ 
able and that at some other time they must have been different. 
It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern 
life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bare¬ 
ness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if you looked about 
you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed 
out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party 
was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Party 
member, were neutral and nonpolitical, a matter of slogging 
through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning 
a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a ciga¬ 
rette end. The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, 
terrible, and glittering—a world of steel and concrete, of 
monstrous machines and terrifying weapons—a nation of war¬ 
riors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all 
thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, 
perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting—three 
hundred million people all with the same face. The reality 
was decaying, dingy cities, where underfed people shuffled 
to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century 
houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He 
seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of 
a million dust bins, and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs. 
Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling 
helplessly with a blocked wastepipe. 

He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day and 
ninht the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proviq^j 
that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, 

58 


better recreations—that they lived longer, worked shorter 

* hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intel¬ 
ligent. better educated, than the people of fifty years ago. Not 
a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The Party 
claimed, for example, that today forty per cent of adult proles 
were literate; before the Revolution, it was said, the number 
had only been fifteen per cent. The Party claimed that the in¬ 
fant mortality rate was now only a hundred and sixty per 
thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been three 
hundred—and so it went on. It was like a single equation with 
two unknowns. It might very well be that literally every word 
in the history books, even the things that one accepted without 
question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there might never 
have been any such law as the jus priniae noctis, or any such 
creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat. 

Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the 
erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth. Just once in his 
life he had possessed— after the event: that was what counted 
—concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification. 
He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty sec¬ 
onds. In 1973, it must have been—at any rate, it was at about 
the time when he and Katharine had parted. But the really 
relevant date was seven or eight years earlier. 

The story really began in "the middle Sixties, the period of 

• the great purges in which the original leaders of the Rev¬ 

olution were wiped out once and for all. By 1970 none of 
them was left, except Big Brother himself. All the rest had by

cures but which sounded important. All three had 

59 


written long, abject articles in the Times, analyzing the rea¬ 
sons for their defection and promising to make amends. » 

Some time after their release Winston had actually seen 
all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remem¬ 
bered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had 
watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were men 
far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the 
last great figures left over from the heroic early days of the 
Party. The glamor of the underground struggle and the civil 
war still faintly clung to them. He had the feeling,'though 
already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, 
that he had known their names years earlier than he had 
known that of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, 
enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to ex¬ 
tinction within a year or two. No one who had once fallen 
into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end. 
They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave. 

There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. 

It was not wise even to be seen in the neighborhood of such 
people. They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin 
flavored with cloves which was the specialty of the cafe. Of 
the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most im¬ 
pressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous carica¬ 
turist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular 
opinion before and during the Revolution. Even now, at long* 
intervals, his cartoons were appearing in the Times. They 
were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously 
lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a rehashing of 
the ancient themes—slum tenements, starving children, street 
battles, capitalists in top hats—even on the barricades the 
capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats—an endless, 
hopeless effort to get back into the past. He was a monstrous 
man, with a mane of greasy gray hair, his face pouched and 
seamed, with protuberant lips. At one time he must have been 
immensely strong; now his great body was sagging, sloping, 
bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be 
breaking up before one’s eyes, like a mountain crumbling. 

It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now 
remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such a time. 
The place was almost empty. A tinny music was trickling 
from the telescreens. The three men sat in their corner almost 
motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought 
fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table 
beside them, with the pieces set out, but no game started * 
And then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something hap+ 
pened to the telescreens. The tune that they were playing 



changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came 
„ into it—but it was something hard to describe. It was a pe¬ 
culiar, cracked, braying, jeering note; in his mind Winston 
called it a yellow note. And then a voice from the telescreen 
was singing: 

“Under the spreading chestnut tree 
I sold you and you sold me: 

There lie they, and here lie we 
Under the spreading chestnut tree. ,f 

The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced 
again at Rutherford’s ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were 
full of tears. And for the first time he noticed, with a kind of 
inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what he shuddered, 
that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses. 

A little later all three were rearrested. It appeared that they 
had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of 
their release. At their second trial they confessed to all their 
old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones. They 
were executed, and their fate was recorded in the Party his¬ 
tories, a warning to posterity. About five years after this, in 
1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had 
just flopped out of the pneumatic tube onto his desk when 
he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been 
.'•slipped in among the others and then forgotten. The instant 
he had flattened it out he saw its significance. It was a half¬ 
page torn out of the Times of about ten years earlier—the 
top half of the page, so that it included the date—and it con¬ 
tained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function 
in New York. Prominent in the middle of the group were 
Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was no mistaking 
them; in any case their names were in the caption at the bot¬ 
tom. 

The point was that at both trials all three men had con¬ 
fessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. They 
had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous 
somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of the 
Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important 
military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston’s memory be¬ 
cause it chanced to be Midsummer Day; but the whole story 
must be on record in countless other places as well. There was 
only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies. 

Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that 
time Winston had not imagined that the people who were 
■^viped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes 
t that they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence; 

61 - 


it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone 
which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geologicaU 
theory. It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some 
way it could have been published to the world and its sig¬ 
nificance made known. 

He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what 
the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it 
up with another sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled it, 
it had been upside-down from the point of view of the tele¬ 
screen. 

He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back 
his chair, so as to get as far away from the telescreen as pos¬ 
sible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and 
even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort; but 
you could not control the beating of your heart, and the tele¬ 
screen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let what 
he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while 
by the fear that some accident—a sudden draught blowing 
across his desk, for instance—would betray him. Then, with¬ 
out uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the 
memory hole, along with some other waste papers. Within 
another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes. 

That was ten—eleven years ago. Today, probably, he 
would have kept that photograph. It was curious that the fact 
of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a dif-* 
ference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as 
the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party s 
hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece 
of evidence which existed no longer had once existed? 

But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected 
from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence. 
Already, at the time when he made his discovery, Oceania 
was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must have been to 
the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed 
their country. Since then there had been other changes two, 
three, he could not remember how many. Vel*y likely the con¬ 
fessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original 
facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance. The 
past not only changed, but changed continuously. What most 
afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had 
never clearly understood why the huge imposture was under¬ 
taken. The immediate advantages of falsifying the past wera 
obvious, but the ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up 
his pen again and wrote: 0$ 

l understand HOW: 1 do not understand WHY. 

62 


He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, 
whether he himself was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was 
* simply a minority of one. At one time it had been a sign of 
madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, 
to believe that the past is unalterable. He might be alone in 
holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought 
of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him; the horror was 
that he might also be wrong. 

He picked up the children’s history book and looked at 
the potrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. 
The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. It was as though some 
huge force were pressing down upon you—something that 
penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, 
frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, 
to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party 
would announce that two and two made five, and you would 
have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make 
that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded 
it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence 
of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy. 
The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was 
terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking other¬ 
wise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we 
know that two and two make four? Or that the force of grav¬ 
ity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past 
and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind 
itself is controllable—what then? 

But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own 
accord. The face of O’Brien, not called up by any obvious 
association, had floated into his mind. He knew, with more 
certainty than before, that O’Brien was on his side. He was 
writing the diary for O'Brien —to O'Brien; it was like an in¬ 
terminable letter which no one would ever read, but which 
was addressed to a particular person and took its color from 
that fact. 

The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and 
ears. It was their final, most essential command. His heart 
sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against 
him, the ease with which any Party intellectual would over¬ 
throw him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would 
not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was 
in the right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, 
the silly, and the true had got to be defended. Truisms are 
true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not 
^change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported 
fall toward the earth's center. With the feeling that he was 

63 


speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an im¬ 
portant axiom, he wrote: 


Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. 
If that is granted, all else follows. 


VIII 

From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of 
roasting coffee—real coffee, not Victory Coffee—came float¬ 
ing out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily. For per¬ 
haps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of 
his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut off the 
smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound. 

He had walked several kilometers over pavements, and his 
varicose ulcer was throbbme. This was the second time in 
three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community 
Center: a rash act. since you could be certain that the num¬ 
ber of your attendances at the Center were carefully checked. 

In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was 
never alone except in bed. It was assumed that when he was 
not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in 
s &gt;me kind of communal recreations; to do anything that sug¬ 
gested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, 
was always sliuhtly dangerous. There was a word for it in* 
Ncwspcak: ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and 
eccentricity. But this evening as he came out of the Ministry 
the balminess of the April air had tempted him. The sky was 
a warmer blue than he had seen in that year, and suddenly 
the long, noisy evening at the Center, the boring, exhausting 
games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, 
h id seemed intolerable. On impulse he had turned away from 
the bus stop and wandered ofT into the labyrinth of London, 
first south, then east, then north again, losing himself along 
unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he 

was going. t . .. 

-If there is hope, - ’ he had written in the diary, it lies in 

the proles.” The words kept coming back to him. statement 
of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. He was some¬ 
where in the vaeuc, brown-colored slums to the north ana 
cast of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was 
walking up a cobbled street of little two-story houses witn 
liattered doorways which gave straight on the pavement an . 
which were somehow curiously suggestive of rat holes. There ^ 
were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles.. 
In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alleyways 

64 


that branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonish¬ 
ing numbers—girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked 
mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen wad¬ 
dling women who showed you what the girls would be like 
in ten years time, and old bent creatures shuffling along on 
splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played in 
the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their 
mothers. Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were 
broken and boarded up. Most of the people paid no attention 
to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity. 
Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded across 
their aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught 
scraps of conversation as he approached. 

“‘Yes,’ I say^ to ’er, ‘That’s all very well,' I says. ‘But if 
you'd been in my place you’d of done the same as what I 
done. It’s easy to criticize,” I says, “but you ain't got the 
same problems as what I got.’ ” 

“Ah,” said the other, “that’s jest it. That’s jest where it is.” 
The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied 
him in hostile silence as he went past. But it was not hostil¬ 
ity, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffen¬ 
ing, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. The blue 
overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a 
street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such 
■■places, unless you had definite business there. The patrols 
might stop you if you happened to run into them. “May I 
see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What 
time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?”— 
and so on and so forth. Not that there was any rule against 
walking home by an unusual route, but it was enough to draw 
attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it. 

Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were 
yells of warning from all sides. People were shooting into the 
doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt out of a door¬ 
way a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing 
in a puddle, whipped her apron around it, and leapt back 
again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a 
concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, 
ran toward Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky. 

Steamer! he yelled. “Look out, guv’nor! Bang over’ead! 
Lay down quick!” 

Steamer was a nickname which, for some reason, the 
proles applied to rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung him- 
wself on his face. The proles were nearly always right when 
■^hey gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed to pos¬ 
sess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in 

65 


advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets 
supposedly traveled faster than sound. Winston clasped his^ 
iorearms about his head. There was a roar that seemed to* 
make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects patterned 
onto his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered 
with fragments of glass from the nearest window. 

He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 
two hundred meters up the street. A black plume of smoke 
hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which 
a crowd was already forming round the ruins. There was a 
iittle pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and 
in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he 
got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the 
wrist. Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so com¬ 
pletely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast. 

He kicked the thine into the cutter. and then, to avoid the 
crowd, turned down a side street to the right. Within three 
or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had 
affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going 
on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly twenty 
hours, and the drinking shops which the proles frequented 
( "pubs,” they called them) were choked with customers. 
From their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, 
there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer. 
In an angle formed by a projecting house front three mei&gt; 
were standing very close together, the middle one of them 
holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were 
studying over his shoulders. Even before he was near enough 
to make out the expression on their faces, Winston could see 
absorption in every line of their bodies. It was obviously some 
serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few 
paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up 
and two of the men were in violent altercation. For a moment 
they seemed almost on the point of blows. 

“Can’t you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you 
no number ending in seven ain't won for over fourteen 
months!" 


"Yes it 'as, then!” 

No. it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the ole lot of 'em for over 
two years wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes cm down 
rcg lar as the clock. An' I tell you. no number ending in 

seven—” 

"Yes, a seven 'as won! I could pretty near tell you the^ 
bleeding number. Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in Fdr* 
ruary—second week in February." 

66 


“February your grandmother! I got it all down in black 
-■and white. An’ I tell you, no number—” 

“Oh, pack it in!” said the third man. 

They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back 
when he had gone thirty meters. They were still arguing, with 
vivid, passionate faces. The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out 
of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the 
proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there were 
some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the prin¬ 
cipal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their 
delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. 


Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could 
barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calcula¬ 
tions and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe 
of men who made a living simply by selling systems, fore¬ 
casts, and lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with 
the running of the Lottery, which was managed by the Min¬ 
istry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone in the 
Party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. 
Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the 
big prizes being nonexistent persons. In the absence of any 
real intercommunication between one part of Oceania and 
another, this was not difficult to arrange. 

But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling 
^on to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable; 
it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on 
the pavement that it became an act of faith. The street into 
which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he 
had been in this neighborhood before, and that there was a 
main thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead 
there came a din of shouting voices. The street took a sharp 
turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into 
a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tired- 
looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered 
where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down 
the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk shop 
where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary. 
And in a small stationer’s shop not far away he had bought 
his penholder and his bottle of ink. b 

He paused for a moment at the top of the steps On the 
opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose 
windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were 

£M*iXh ^hhe^ T' th K dUS K V Cry ° ,d man ’ bent but Active, 
. ^ StaChe l that . bnSt,cd forward likc of a 

p vn, pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston 

stood watching it occurred to him that the old man, who 



must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged 
when the Revolution happened. He and a few others like him, 
were the last links that now existed with the vanished world 
of capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people 
left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution. The 
older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great 
purges of the Fifties and Sixties, and the few who survived 
had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surren¬ 
der. It there was anyone still alive who could give you a truth¬ 
ful account of conditions in the early part of the century, it 
could only be a prole. Suddenly the passage from the history 
book that he had copied into his diary came back into Win¬ 
ston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold of him. He would 
go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that old 
man and question him. He would say to him: “Tell me about 
your life when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? 
Were things better than they are now, or were they worse? 

Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, 
he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. It was 
madness, of course. As usual, there was no definite rule 
against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but it 
was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the pa¬ 
trols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it 
was not likely that they would believe him. He pushed open 
the door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him it* 
the face. As he entered, the din of voices dropped to about 
half its volume. Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing 
his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at the 
other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much 
as thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followed was 
standing at the bar, having some kind of altercation with the 
barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young man with enormous 
forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses in 
their hands, were watching the scene. 

“I arst you civil enough, didn't I?” said the old man. 
straightening his shoulders pugnaciously. "You telling me you 
ain't got a pint mug in the ’ole bleeding boozer?’’ 

“And what in hell’s name is a pint?” said the barman, lean¬ 
ing forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter. 

“ 'Ark at ’im! Calls ’isself a barman and don't know what 
a pint is! Why, a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four 
quarts to the gallon. ’Ave to teach you the A. B. C next.” 

“Never heard of ’em." said the barman shortly. “Liter and 
half liter—that’s all wc serve. There’s the glasses on the shelly. 

in front of you.” * 

"I like a pint,” persisted the old man. “You could ’a drawed 

68 


me off a pint easy enough. We didn’t ’ave these bleeding liters 
.when I was a young man.” 

“When you were a young man we were all living in the 
treetops,” said the barman, with a glance at the other custom¬ 
ers. 

There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused 
by Winston’s entry seemed to disappear. The old man’s white- 
stubbled face had flushed pink. He turned away, muttering to 
himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught him gently 
by the arm. 

“May I offer you a drink?" he said. 

"You're a gent,” said the other, straightening his shoulders 
again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue over¬ 
alls. "Pint!” he added aggressively to the barman. "Pint of 
wallop.” 

The barman swished two half-liters of dark-brown beer 
into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the 
counter. Beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs. 
The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in practice 
they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of darts 
was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had 
begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston’s presence was 
forgotten for a moment. There was a deal table under the 
window where he and the old man could talk without fear of 
4»eing overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but at any rate 
there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure 
of as soon as he came in. 

"’E could ’a drawed me off a pint.” grumbled the old man 
as he settled down behind his glass. "A~alf liter ain’t enough. 
It don’t satisfy. And a 'ole liter's too much. It starts my blad¬ 
der running. Let alone the price.” 

“You must have seen great changes since you were a young 
man." said Winston tentatively. 

The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board 
to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents, as 
though it were in the barroom that he expected the charges 
to have occurred. 


“The beer was better," he said finally. "And cheaper! When 
I was a young man, mild beer—wallop, we used to call it_ 

Wa ^/;u Ur P €ncC a pint ' That was bcfore the war, of course." 
Which war was that?” said Winston. 

ol * ts a !l u- arS, u sa ,\ d the oId man va ?uely. He took up his 
class, and his shoulders straightened again. "'Ere’s wishing 
M ou the very best of ’ealth!" 

surnrkinjuf" th « sharp -P 0 inted Adam’s apple made a 

surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beer van- 



ishcd. Winston went to the bar and came back with two more 
halt-liters. The old man appeared to have forgotten his 
prejudice against drinking a full liter. 

"You are very much older than I am,” said Winston. “You 
must have been a grown man before I was born. You can 
remember what it was like in the old days, before the Revolu¬ 
tion. People of my age don't really know anything about those 
times. We can only read about them in books, and what it 
says in the books may not be true. I should like your opinion 
on that. The history books say that life before the Revolution 
was completely different from what it is now. There was the 
most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty—worse than any¬ 
thing we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass of 
the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half 
of them hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve 
hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room. 
And at the same time there were a very few people, only a 
few thousands—the capitalists, they were called—who were 
rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was to 
own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, 
they rode about in motor cars and four-horse carriages, they 
drank champagne, they wore top hats—” 

The old man brightened suddenly. 

“Top ’ats!" he said. “Funny you should mention ’em. The 
same thing come into my ’cad only yesterday. I donno why. 

1 was jest thinking, I ain’t seen a top ’at in years. Gorn right 
out, they ’avc. The last time I wore one was at my sister-in- 
law's funeral. And that was—well, I couldn't give you the 
date, but it must ‘a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 
'ired for the occasion, vou understand.’’ 


“It isn’t very important about the top hats.” said Winston 
patiently. "The point is. these capitalists—they and a few 
lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—were 
the lords of the earth. Everything existed for their benefit. 
You—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves. 
They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you 
off to Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters 
if they chose. They could order you to be Hogged with some¬ 
thing called a cat-o’-nine-tails. You had to take your cap on 
when you passed them. Every capitalist went about with a 
gang of lackeys who—’ 

The old man brightened again. , 

“Lackeys!” he said. "Nov*- there's a word 1 ain’t ’card since 
ever so long. Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that doe^« 
I recollect—oh. donkey's years ago— I used to sometimes 
to Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to ear the blokes making 



y 


speeches. Salvation Army. Roman Catholics, Jews, Indians— 
^all sorts, there was. And there was one bloke—well, 1 couldn’t 
give you ’is name, but a real powerful speaker, ’e was. 'E 
didn't ’alf give it ’em! ’Lackeys!’ ’e says. ‘Lackeys of the 
bourgeoisie! Flunkies of the ruling class!’ Parasites—that was 
another of them. And ’yenas—'e def-nitely called ’em ’yenas. 
Of course e was referring to the Labour Party, you under¬ 
stand." 


Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross 
purposes. 

"What I really wanted to know was this," he said. "Do 
you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in 
those days? Are you treated more like a human being? In 
the old days, the rich people, the people at the top—’’ 

“The Ouse of Lords,” put in the old man reminiscently. 

The House ot Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, 
were these people able to treat you as an inferior, simply 
because they were rich and you were poor? Is it a fact, for 
instance, that you had to call them ‘Sir’ and take off your cap 
when you passed them?" 


The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about 
a quarter of his beer before answering. 

Yes, he said. “They liked you to touch your cap to ’em. 
It showed respect, like. I didn’t agree with it, myself, but I 
-**Jone it often enough. Had to, as you might say." 

And was it usual—I m only quoting what I've read in 
history books was it usual for these people and their servants 
to push you off the pavement into the gutter?” 

"One of ’em pushed me once.” said the old man. "I recol¬ 
lect it as if it was yesterday. It was Boat Race night—terrible 
rowdy they used to get on Boat Race night—and I bumps 
into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue. Quite the geni, 'e 
was—dress shirt, top ’at, black overcoat. ’E was kind of zig¬ 
zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into ’im accidental- 
jike. fc, says. ‘Why can’t you look where you’re going?’ ’e savs. 
I says, Ju think you've bought the bleeding pavement?’ ’E

I says. An if you'll believe me, ’e puts 'is ’and on mv chest 
and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels 

. , “ f„ U , S , W , e l - 1 was V° un S 'n 'hem days, and I was uoina to

A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old 

«T" S r m .° r y u as n ?, thing but a rubbish hca P of details. One 

tk&gt;n d ThTp 0r ; !!" 3 • day without S c »ing any real informa- 
ton. The Party histones might still be true, after a fashion* 



they might even be completely true. He made a last attempt*. 

"Perhaps 1 have not made myself clear,” he said. “What 
I'm trying to say is this. You have been alive a very long time; 
you lived half your life before the Revolution. In 1925, for 
instance, you were already grown up. Would you say, from 
what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it is 
now. or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live 
then or now?” 

The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He 
finished up his beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke 
it was with a tolerant, philosophic air, as though the beer had 
mellowed him. 

"I know what you expect me to say,” he said. "You expect 
me to say as I'd sooner be young again. Most people d say 
they'd sooner be young, if you arst ’em. You got your 'ealth 
and strength when you're young. When you get to my time of 
life you ain't never well. I suffer something wicked from my 
feet, and my bladder’s jest terrible. Six and seven times a night 
it ’as me out of bed. On the other 'and there's great advantages 
in being an old man. You ain't got the same worries. No truck 
with women, and that’s a great thing. I ain’t ’ad a woman for 
near on thirty year, if you'd credit me. Nor wanted to, what s 
more.” 

Winston sat back against the window sill. It was no us- 
going on. He was about to buy some more beer when the old 
man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking 
urinal at the side of the room. The extra half-liter was already 
working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at 
his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him 
out into the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he 
reflected, the huge and simple question, "Was life better be¬ 
fore the Revolution than it is now?" would have ceased once 
and for all to be answerable. But in effect it was unanswerable 
even now. since the few scattered survivors from the ancient 
world were incapable of comparing one age with another. 
They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a 
workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on 
a lone-dead sister’s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning 
seventy years ago; but all the relevant facts were outside the 
range ot their vision. They were like the ant, which can see 
small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed 
and written records were falsified—when that happened, the 
claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human, 
life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, aa 
never again could exist, any standard against which it cou 
be tested. 


72 


At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He 
halted and looked up. He was in a narrow street, with a few 
•’■dark little shops interspersed among dwelling houses. Im¬ 
mediately above his head there hung three discolored metal 
balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He seemed 
to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk 
shop where he had bought the diary. 

A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently 
rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn 
never to come near the place again. And yet the instant that 
he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had brought him 
back here of their own accord. It was precisely against sui¬ 
cidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself 
by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that al¬ 
though it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. 
With the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than 
hanging about on the pavement, he stepped through the door¬ 
way. If questioned, he could plausibly say that he was trying 
to buy razor blades. 

The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which 
gave off an unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of per¬ 
haps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and 
mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles. His hair was almost 
white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. His spec¬ 
tacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he was 
wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air 
of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary 
man, or perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though 
faded, and his accent less debased than that of the majority 
of proles. 


I recognized you on the pavement,” he said immediately. 

You re the gentleman that bought the young lady’s keep¬ 
sake album. That was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. Cream 
laid, it used to be called. There's been no paper like that made 
for—oh, I dare say fifty years.” He peered at Winston over 
the top of his spectacles. “Is there anything special 1 can do 
for you? Or did you just want to look round?” 

I was passing,” said Winston vaguely. ”1 just looked in. I 
don t want anything in particular.” 

It’s just as well,” said the other, “because I don't suppose 
could have satisfied you.” He made an apologetic gesture 
with his soft-palmed hand. “You see how it is; an empty shop, 
you might say. Between you and me, the antique trade’s just 
®bout finished. No demand any longer, and no stock either, 
r urniture, china, glass—it’s all been broken up by degrees. 



And ot course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I 
haven't seen a brass candlestick in years.” 

The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably 
full, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. 
The floor space was very restricted, because all round the 
walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture frames. In the 

window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out chisels, 

* 

penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not 
even pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous 
rubbish. Only on a small table in the corner was there a litter 
of odds and ends—lacquered snuffboxes, agate brooches, and 
the like—which looked as though they might include some¬ 
thing interesting. As Winston wandered toward the table his 
eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly 
in the lamplight, and he picked it up. 

It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on 
the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar 
softness, as of rainwater, in both the color and the texture of 
the glass. At the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, 
there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a 

rose or a sea anemone. 

“What is it?” said Winston, fascinated. 

‘That's coral, that is." said the old man. Tt must have 
come from the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it 
in the glass. That wasn't made less than a hundred years ago. 
More, by the look of it." 

“It's a beautiful thing.” said Winston. 

“It is a beautiful thing,” said the other appreciatively. “But 
there’s not many that’d say so nowadays." He coughed. “Now, 
if it so happened that you wanted to buy it. that d cost you 
four dollars. I can remember when a thing like that worn 
have fetched eieht pounds, and eight pounds was well, 
can’t work it out. but it was a lot of money. But who cares 
about genuine antiques nowadays—even the lew that s ' c ; 

Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid 
the coveted thing into his pocket. What appealed to him 
about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to 
possess ot belonging to an age quite different from the presen 
one The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass tha 
he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of 
its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it mus 
once have ben intended as a paperweight. It was ver\ heavy 
in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bu^c. 

It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a i any 
member to have in his possession. Anything oId. and for thaf^ 
matter anvthing beautiful, was always vaguely suspec 

7-1 


old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving 
the four dollars. Winston realized that he would have accepted 
* three or even two. 

“There’s another room upstairs that you might care to take 
a look at,” he said. “There’s not much in it. Just a few pieces. 
We’ll do with a light if we're going upstairs.” 

He lit another lamp and, with bowed back, led the way 
slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, 
into a room which did not give on the street but looked out 
on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney pots. Winston 
noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the 
room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet 
on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slat¬ 
ternly armchair drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned 
glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the 
mantlepiece. Under the window, and occupying nearly a quar¬ 
ter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still 
on it. 

“We lived here till my wife died,” said the old man half 
apologetically. “I’m selling the furniture off by little and little. 
Now that’s a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it would be 
if you could get the bugs out of it. But I dare say you’d find 
it a little bit cumbersome.” 

He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illumine the 
^vhole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked 
curiously inviting. The thought flitted through Winston’s mind 
that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a 
few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a wild, 
impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but 
the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of 
ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly 
what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an armchair be¬ 
side an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on 
the hob, utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody watching 
you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of 
the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock. 

There’s no telescreen!” he could not help murmuring.- 
Ah, * said the old man, “I never had one of those things. 
Too expensive. And I never seemed to feel the need of it, 
^mehow. Now that’s a nice gateleg table in the corner there. 
Though of course you’d have to put new hinges on it if you 
wanted to use the flaps.” 

There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Win- 

8 ston had already gravitated toward it. It contained nothing 
r u n ff ) hish. The hunting-down and destruction of books had 
been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters 

75 


as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed 
anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than^ 
1960. The old man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in 
front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the 
other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed. 

“Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all 

he began delicately. 

Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel 
engravinc of an oval building with rectangular windows, and 
a small tower in front. There was a railing running round the 
building, and at the rear end there was what appeared to be 
a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It seemed 
vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue. 
“The frame's fixed to the wall,” said the old man, “but I 

could unscrew it for you, I dare say.” 

“I know that building," said Winston finally. It s a ruin 
now. It's in the middle of the street outside the Palace of 


Justice." „ , , , 

“That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in— 

oh, manv years ago. It was a church at one time. St. Clement s 
Dane, its name was." He smiled apologetically, as though con¬ 
scious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and added: 
“Oranges and lemons, says the bells of St. Clement s. 

“What's that?” said Winston. r _ # 

‘•Oh —Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St. Clement V 

That was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy. How i 
coes on I don't remember, but I do know it ended up, H

their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to

their arms down and caught you. It was just names of 
churches. All the London churches were in it—all the pnn 

C,P Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church be- 
longed. It was always difficult to determine the age of 
London building. Anything large and .mpressivc ,f it wa 
reasonably new in appearance, was automatically cla mod a 
havine been built since the Revolution, while anything that 
was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period 
called the Middle Aces. The centuries of capitalism were I *- 
to have produced nothing of any value. One could not learn 
history from architecture any more than one couldlearn U 
from books Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the namejjN 
of°Ttreets—anything that might throw light upon the pa/ 

had been systematically altered. 

76 


"I never knew it had been a church,” he said. 

“There’s a lot of them left, really,” said the old man, 
, “though they’ve been put to other uses. Now, how did that 
rhyme go? Ah! I’ve got it! 

Oranges and lemons, say the hells of St. Clement’s, 

You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St. Martin s — 


} there, now, that’s as far as I can get. A farthing, that was a 
V, small copper coin, looked something like a cent.” 

’ "Where was St. Martin’s?” said Winston. 

“St. Martin’s? That’s still standing. It’s in Victory Square, 
alongside the picture gallery. A building with a kind of a 
triangular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps.” 

Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for 
t propaganda displays of various kinds—scale models of rocket 
| bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating 
» enemy atrocities, and the like. 

“St. Martin’s in the Fields it used to be called,” supple¬ 
mented the old man, “though I don’t recollect any fields any¬ 
where in those parts.” 


Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an 
even more incongruous possession than the glass paper¬ 
weight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken 
..tout of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more, 
talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not 
i Weeks as one might have gathered from the inscription 
i over the shopfront—but Charrington. Mr. Charrington, it 
i seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited 
this shop for thirty years. Throughout that time he had been

, q u,te 8ot to the point of doing it. All the while that they 
were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through 
Winstons head: Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St. 
Clement s You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St. 
Mar/m s. It was curious, but when you said it to yourself you 
had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost

77 


perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the 
Center. The serious piece of folly had been to come back^ 
here in the first place, after buying the diary and without 
knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted. 
However—! 

Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy 
further scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engrav¬ 
ing of St. Clement’s Dane, take it out of its frame, and carry 
it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. He would 
drag the rest of that poem out of Mr. Charrington’s memory. 
Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed 
momentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five seconds 
exaltation made him careless, and he stepped out onto the 
pavement without so much as a preliminary' glance through 
the window. He had even started humming to an improvised 

tune— 

Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St. Clement s, 

You owe me three farthings, say the — 


Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to 
water. A figure in blue overalls was coming down the pave¬ 
ment, not ten meters away. It was the girl from the Fic 10 
Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was failing., 
but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked hi 
straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she h 

not seen him. , . 

For a few seconds Winston was too paralyzed to move. 

Then he turned to the right and walked heavily ® wa &gt;j 
noticing for the moment that he was going in the vuo „ 
direction. At any rate, one question was settled. I he re 
no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him- b 
must have followed him here, because it was not credible 1 
by pure chance she should have happened to be wa king 
the same evening up the same obscure back street, i 
distant from any quarter where Party members lived, t ^ 
too great a coincidence. Whether she was really a • 
the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actl,at ' 
officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough that sh . 
watching him. Probably she had seen him go into the puu 

"ll'was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in hispocW 
banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half mi 
to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was th P “1. 
in his belly. For a couple of minutes he had the ™ 

he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon, but 

78 



would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the 
* spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind. 

The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for 
several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned 
round and began to retrace his steps. As he turned it oc¬ 
curred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes 
ago and that by running he could probably catch up with 
her. He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet 
place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The 
piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the 
job. But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even 
the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He 
could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was 
young and lusty and would defend herself. He thought also 
of hurrying to the Community Center and staying there till 
the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the eve¬ 
ning. But that too was impossible. A deadly lassitude had 
taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly 
and then sit down and be quiet. 

It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. 
The lights would be switched ofT at the main at twenty-three 
thirty. He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a tea¬ 
cupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in the 
alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But 
■"he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy 
female voice was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at 
the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut 
the voice out of his consciousness. 

It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The 
proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. Un¬ 
doubtedly some people did so. Many of the disappearances 
were actually suicides. But it needed desperate courace to kill 
yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and certain 
poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a 
kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and 
fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes 
into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is 
needed. He might have silenced the dark-haired girl if onlv 
he had acted quickly enough; but precisely because of the 
extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck 
him that in moments of crisis one is never fightine aeainst 
an external enemy but always against one’s own body. Even 
now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made con¬ 
secutive thought impossible. And it is the same, he perceived, 
in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the battlefield, 
in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you 

79 


are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells, 
up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not 
paralyzed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment- 
to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, 
against a sour stomach or an aching tooth. 

He opened the diary. It was important to write something 
down. The woman on the telescreen had started a new song. 
Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters 
of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien, for whom, or to whom, 
the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the 
things that would happen to him after the Thought Police 
took him away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. 
To be killed was what you expected. But before death (no¬ 
body spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) 
there was the routine of confession that had to be gone 
through: the groveling on the floor and screaming for mercy, 
the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots 
of hair. Why did you have to endure it, since the end was 
always the same? Why was it not possible to cut a few days 
or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped detection, 
and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had suc¬ 
cumbed to thought-crime it was certain that by a given date 
you would be dead. Why then did that horror, which altered 
nothing, have to lie embedded in future time? v 

He tried with a little more success than before to summon 
up the image of O'Brien. “We shall meet in the place where 
there is no darkness,” O’Brien had said to him. He knew 
what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where there is 
no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never 
see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share 
in. But with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears 
he could not follow the train of thought further. He put a 
cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco promptly fell out on¬ 
to" his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out 
aoain. The^face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing 
that of O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he 
slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed 
up at him, heavy, calm, protecting, but what kind of smile 
was hidden beneath the dark mustache? Like a leaden knei 
the words came back at him: 

WAR IS PEACE 

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY K 

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.

TWO 


It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had i eft 
his cubicle to go to the lavatory. 

A solitary figure was coming toward him from the other 
end of the long, brightly lit corridor. It was the girl with dark 
hair. Four days had gone past since the evening when he had 
run into her outside the junk shop. As she came nearer he 
saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a 
distance because it was of the same color as her overalls. 
Probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round 
one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels 

were “roughed in.“ It was a common accident in the Fiction 
Department. 

They were perhaps four meters apart when the girl stum¬ 
bled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp erv of pain was 
wrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured 
arm Winston stopped short. The girl had risen to her knees. 
Her face had turned a milky yellow color against which her 
mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on 

his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear 
than pain. 

A curious emotion stirred in Winston’s heart. In front of 

him was an enemy who was trying to kill him; in front of 

him, also was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with 

a br oken bone. Already he had instinctively start'd forward 

to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the 

bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his 
own oody. 

You're hurt?” he said. 

dt’s nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.” 

bhe spoke as though her heart were fluttering She had 
certainly turned very pale. S ‘ nad 

'You haven’t broken anything?” 

She°hLd out U h K Urt l° r a moment &gt; that's all.” 

d • ? er free hand to him &gt; and he helped her ud 

4a ' ■ °»'y ® ave -y wrist 

And With that she walked on in the direction in which she 

81 


u 




it 



had been going, as briskly as though it had really been noth¬ 
ing. The whole incident could not have taken as much as half 
a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear in one’s face was a 
habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any 
case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen 
when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very diffi¬ 
cult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or 
three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had 
slipped something into his hand. There was no question that 
she had done it intentionally. It was something small and flat. 
As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to 
his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap 
of paper folded into a square. 

While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more 
fingering, to get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a mes¬ 
sage of some kind written on it. For a moment he was tempted 
to take it into one of the water closets and read it at once. 
But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. There was 
no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens 
were watched continuously. 

He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment 
of paper casually among the other papers on the desk, put on 
his spectacles and hitched the speakwritc toward him. ‘ Five 
minutes,” he told himself, “five minutes at the very least!" 
His heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudnes^ 
Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on v.as mere 
routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing 
close attention. 

Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind 
of political meaning. So far as he could see there were two 
possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that the girl 
was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared. He 
did not know why the Thought Police should choose to de- 
liver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had 
their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might 
be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap 
of some description. But there was another, wilder possibility 
that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress 
it. This was. that the message did not come from the Though 
Police at all. but from some kind of underground organiza¬ 
tion. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the 
girl was part of it! No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had 
sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap 
of paper in his hand. It was not till a couple of minutes later 
that the other, more probable explanation had occurred tyb 
him. And even now, though his intellect told him that the 

82 



message probably meant death—still, that was not what he 
believed, and the unreasonable hope persisted, and his heart 
* banged, and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from 
trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwritc. 

He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into 
the pneumatic tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He readjusted 
his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch of 
work toward him, with the scrap of paper on top of it. He 
flattened it out. On it was written, in a large unformed hand¬ 
writing: 


I love you. 

For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the 
incriminating thing into the memory hole. When he did so, 
although he knew very well the danger of showing too much 
interest, he could not resist reading it once again, just to make 
sure that the words were really there. 

For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. 
What was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series 
of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from 
the telescreen. He felt as though a fire were burning in his 
belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen was 
torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while during 
^ the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the jmbecile 
Parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat al¬ 
most defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream 
of talk about the preparations for Hate Week. He was par¬ 
ticularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of Big 
Brother’s head, two meters wide, which was being made for 
the occasion by his daughter’s troop of Spies. The irritating 
thing was that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly 
hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantly having to 
ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once he 
caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls 
at the far end of the room. She appeared not to have seen 
him, and he did not look in that direction again. 

The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch 
there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would 
take several hours and necessitated putting everything else 
aside. It consisted in falsifying a series of production reports 
of two years ago in such a way as to cast discredit on a promi¬ 
nent member of the Inner Party who was now under a cloud. 
This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and 
^for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out 
of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her face came 

83 



back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. Until 
he could be alone it was impossible to think this new develop¬ 
ment out. Tonight was one of his nights at the Community* 
Center. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, 
hurried off to the Center, took part in the solemn foolery of a 
“discussion group,” played two games of table tennis, swal¬ 
lowed several glasses of gin, and sat for half an hour through 
a lecture entitled “Ingsoc in relation to chess.” His soul 
writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse 
to shirk his evening at the Center. At the sight of the words 
/ love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and 
the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not 
till twenty-three hours, when he was home and in bed—in the 
darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so 
long as you kept silent—that he was able to think continu¬ 
ously. 

It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to 
get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not 
consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying 
some kind of trap for him. He knew that it was not so, be¬ 
cause of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the 
note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as 
well she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances 
even cross his mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated 
smashing her skull in with a cobblestone; but that was of no 
importance. He thought of her naked, youthful body, as he haa 
seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a fool like all the 
rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly 
full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he 
might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from 
him! What he feared more than anything else was that she 
would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with 
her quickly. But the physical difficulty of meeting was enor¬ 
mous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when you 
were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen 
faced you. Actually, all the possible ways of communicating 
with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading 
the note; but now, with time to think, he went over them one 
by one, as though laying out a row of instruments on a table. 

Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this 
morning could not be repeated. If she had worked in the 
Records Department it might have been comparatively simple, 
but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building 
the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going 
there. If he had known where she lived, and at what time shc.*&gt; 
left work, he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on 

84 



her way home; but to try to follow her home was not safe, 
because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry, 
* which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a letter through 
the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine that was not 
even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few 
people ever wrote letters. For the message that it was oc¬ 
casionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards 
with long lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that 
were inapplicable. In any case he did not know the girl’s 
name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the safest 
place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by her¬ 
self, somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the 
telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all 
round—if these conditions endured for, say, thirty seconds, 
it might be possible to exchange a few words. 

For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the 
next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving 
it, the whistle having already blown. Presumably she had been 
changed onto a later shift. They passed each other without a 
glance. On the day after that she was in the canteen at the 
usual time, but with three other girls and immediately under 
a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear 
at all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an 
unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made 
^ every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that 
he had to speak or listen to, an agony. Even in his sleep he 
could not altogether escape from her image. He did not touch 
the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in 
his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten 
minutes at a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had 
happened to her. There was no inquiry he could make. She 
might have been vaporized, she might have committed suicide, 
she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania 
worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed 
her mind and decided to avoid him. 

The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling 
and she had a band of sticking plaster round her wrist. The 
relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist star¬ 
ing directly at her for several seconds. On the following day 
he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came 
into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the 
wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was 
not very full. The queue edged forward till Winston was al¬ 
most at the counter, then was held up for two minutes be¬ 
cause someone in front was complaining that he had not re¬ 
ceived his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone 

85 



when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her 
table. He walked casually toward her, his eyes searching for a 
place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three meters* 
away from him. Another two seconds would do it. Then a 
voice behind him called, ‘ Smith!” He pretended not to hear. 
’Smith!” repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He 
turned round. A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named 
Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smile 
to a vacant place at his table. It was not safe to refuse. After 
having been recognized, he could not go and sit at a table with 
an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with 
a friendly smile. The silly blonde face beamed into his. Win¬ 
ston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pickax right 
into the middle of it. The girl’s table filled up a few minutes 
later. 

But she must have seen him coming toward her. and per¬ 
haps she would take the hint. Next day he took care to 
arrive early. Sure enough, she was at a table in about the 
same place, and again alone. The person immediately ahead 
of him in the queue was a small, swiftly moving, beetlelike 
man with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston 
turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the 
little man was making straight for the girl’s table. His hopes 
sank again. There was a vacant place at a table further away, 
but something in the little man’s appearance suggested that 
he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to 
choose the emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston fol¬ 
lowed. It was no use unless he could get the girl alone. At 
this moment there was a tremendous crash. The little man 
was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, two 
streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He 
started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom 
he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. But it was 
all right. Five seconds later, with a thundering heart, Winston 
was sitting at the girl’s table. 

He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly 
began eating. It was all-important to speak at once, before 
anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken posses¬ 
sion of him. A week had gone by since she had first ap 
proached. She would have changed her mind, she must has 
changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should 
end successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He 
might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this mo¬ 
ment he had not seen Amplcforth. the hairy-eared poet, wan¬ 
dering limply round the room with a tray. looking for a placa. 
to sit down, in his vague way Amplcforth was attached to 

86 


Winston, and would certainly sit down at his tabic if he calight 
^ sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. 
Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they 
were eating was a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. 
In a low murmur Winston began speaking. Neither of them 
looked up; steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their 
mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary 
words in low expressionless voices. 

“What time do you leave work?" 

“Eighteen thirty.” 

“Where can we meet?” 

“Victory Square, near the monument.” 

' “It’s full of telescreens.” 

“It doesn't matter if there’s a crowd.” 

“Any signal?” 

“No. Don’t come up to me until you see me among a lot 

of people. And don t look at me. Just keep somewhere near 
me.” 

“What time?” 

“Nineteen hours.” 

“All right.” 

Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another 
table. The girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while 
Winston stayed to smoke a cigarette. They did not speak 
&lt;ir’ a s ain \ and &lt; so far as it was possible for two people sitting on 
opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one 
another. 


f Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. 
He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column, 
at the top of which Big Brother’s statue gazed southward to- 
ward the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian airplanes 
(the Eastasian airplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the 
Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there was a 
statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent 
O.iver Cromwell At five minutes past the hour the girl had 
s iH not appeared. Again the terrible fear seized upon Win- 

w-iMfpH h&lt; "i W ? S n0t con u 1,n .e- she had changed her mind! He

was a dm of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from 

87 


somewhere to the left. Suddenly everyone seemed to be run¬ 
ning across the square. The girl nipped nimbly round the lions 
at the base of the monument and joined in the rush. Winston r 
followed. As he ran. he gathered from some shouted remarks 
that a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing. 

Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south 
side of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind of per¬ 
son who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrim¬ 
mage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into the heart 
of the crowd. Soon he was within arm’s length of the girl, but 
the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost 
equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who seemed 
to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. Winston wriggled him¬ 
self sideways, and with a violent lunge managed to drive his 
shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his 
entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular 
hips, then he had broken through, sweating a little. He was 
next to the girl. They were shoulder to shoulder, both staring 
fixedly in front of them. 

A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed 
with submachine guns standing upright in each corner, was 
passing slowly down the street. In the trucks little yellow men 
in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed close to¬ 
gether. Their sad Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides 
of the trucks, utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck*- 
jolted there was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were 
wearing lee irons. Truckload after truckload of the sad faces 
passed. Winston knew they were there, but he saw them only 
intermittently. The girl’s shoulder, and her arm right down to 
the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was almost near 
enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken 
charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. 
She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, 
with lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by 
the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks. 

"Can you hear me?” 

"Yes.” 

"Can you get Sunday afternoon off?” 

"Yes.” 

"Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember this. Go to 

Paddington Station—” . 

With* a sort of military precision that astonished him, sne 

outlined the route that he was to follow. A half-hour rail¬ 
way journey; turn left outside the station; two kilometers 
along the road; a gate with the top bar missing; a path acrosr 
a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead 

88 


tree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside 
her head. “Can you remember all that?" she murmured finally. 

“Yes.” 

“You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate's 
got no top bar.” 

“Yes. What time?” 

“About fifteen. You may have to wait. I'll get there by an¬ 
other way. Are you sure you remember everything?” 

“Yes.” 

"Then get away from me as quick as you can.” 

She need not have told him that. But for the moment they 
could not extricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks 
were still filing past, the people still insatiably gaping. At the 
start there had been a few boos and hisses, but it came only 
from the Party members among the crowd, and had soon 
stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreign¬ 
ers, whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of 
strange animal. One literally never saw them except in the 
guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got more 
than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did one know what 
became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as war 
criminals; the others simply vanished, presumably into forced- 
labor camps. The round Mongol faces had given way to faces 
^.of a more European type, dirty, bearded, and exhausted. From 
over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into Winston’s, some¬ 
times with strange intensity, and flashed away again. The con¬ 
voy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an 
aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright 
with wrists crossed in front of him, as though he were used 
to having them bound together. It was almost time for Win¬ 
ston and the girl to part. But at the last moment, while the 
crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for his and gave 
it a fleeting squeeze. 

It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a 
long time that their hands were clasped together. He had 
time to learn every detail of her hand. He explored the long 
fingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with its 
row of calluses, the smooth flesh under the wrist. Merely 
from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the same 
instant it occurred to him that he did not know what color 
s e y es were. They were probably brown, but people 
with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head 
and look at her would have been inconceivable folly. With 
"hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, 
ey stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes 

89 


of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully 
at Winston out of nests of hair. 


Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light 
and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs 
parted. Under the trees to the left of them the ground was 
misty with bluebells. The air seemed to kiss one’s skin. It 
was the second of May. From somewhere deeper in the heart 
of the wood came the droning of ring doves. 

He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties about 
the journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced that 
he was less frightened than he would normally have been. 
Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place. In gen¬ 
eral you could not assume that you were much safer in the 
country than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, 
but there was always the danger of concealed microphones 
by which your voice might be picked up and recognized; 
besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself with¬ 
out attracting attention. For distances of less than a hundred 
kilometers it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, 
but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway 
stations, who examined the papers of any Party member they 
found there and asked awkward questions. However, n6 
patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the station he 
had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not 
being followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood 
because of the summery weather. The wooden-seated car¬ 
riage in which he traveled was filled to overflowing by a single 
enormous family, ranging from a toothless great-grandmother 
to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon with 
“in-laws” in the country, and, as they freely explained to Wi 
ston, to get hold of a little black-market butter. 

The lane widened, and in a minute he came to fhe foot 
path she had told him of, a mere cattle track which plunged 
between the brushes. He had no watch, but it could not be 
fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was 
impossible not to tread on them. He knelt downand g 
picking some, partly to pass the time away, but also from 
vaeue idea that he would like to have a bunch of lowers o 
offer to the girl when they met. He had got together a o 

90 


To look round was to show guilt. He picked another and an- 
?othcr. A hand fell lightly on his shoulder. 

He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently 
as a warning that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes 
and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the 
wood. Obviously she had been that way before, for she dodged 
the boggy pits as though by habit. Winston followed, still 
clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but 
as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, 
with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out 
the curve, of her hips, the sense of his own inferiority was 
heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite likely that when 
she turned round and looked at him she would draw back 
after all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the 
leaves daunted him. Already, on the walk from the station, 
the May sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated, a 
creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of London in the pores 
of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had probably 
never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to 
the fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over 
and forced apart the bushes, in which there did not seem to 
be an opening. When Winston followed her, he found that 
they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy knoll surrounded 
by tall saplings that shut it in completely. The girl stopped 
■*imd turned. 


“Here we are,” she said. 

He was facing her at several paces’ distance. As yet he did 
not dare move nearer to her. 

ti . I didn t want to say anything in the lane,” she went on, 
in case there s a mike hidden there. I don’t suppose there is, 
but there could be. There’s always the chance of one of those 
swine recognizing your voice. We’re all right here.” 

He still had not the courage to approach her. “We’re all 
right here?” he repeated stupidly. 

Yes. Look at the trees.” They were small ashes, which at 
some time had been cut down and had sprouted up again 
I, 1 ?!® a * orcst of poles, none of them thicker than one’s wrist 
There's nothing big enough to hide a mike in. Besides I’ve 
been here before.” 

They were only making conversation. He had managed to 
move closer to her now. She stood before him very upright 
with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical,° as 
though she vvere wondering why he was so slow to act. The 
b uebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to 
^ave fallen of their own accord. He took her hand. 

Would you believe,” he said, “that till this moment I 



didn't know what color your eyes were?” They were brown, 
he noted, a rather light shade of brown, with dark lashes., 

“Now that you’ve seen what I’m really like, can you still 
bear to look at me?” 

“Yes, easily.” 

“I’m thirty-nine years old. I've got a wife that I can’t get 
rid of. I’ve got varicose veins. I’ve got five false teeth.” 

“I couldn’t care less,” said the girl. 

The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was 
in his arms. At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer 
incredulity. The youthful body was strained against his own, 
the mass of dark hair was against his face, and yes! actually 
she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red 
mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was 
calling him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled 
her down on to the ground, she was utterly unresisting, he 
could do what he liked with her. But the truth was that he 
had no physical sensation except that of mere contact. All he 
felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was hap¬ 
pening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her 
youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much 
used to living without women—he did not know the reason. 
The girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her 
hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round his waist. 

“Never mind, dear. There’s no hurry. We’ve got the wholo- 
afternoon. Isn’t this a splendid hide-out? I found it when I 
got lost once on a community hike. If anyone was coming 
you could hear them a hundred meters away.” 

“What is your name?” said Winston. „ 

“Julia. I know yours. It’s Winston—Winston Smith. 

“How did you find that out?” 

“I expect I'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. 
Tell me, what did you think of me beforc'that day I gave you 


He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was 
even a sort of love offering to start off by telling the worst. 

“I hated the sight of you,” he said. “I wanted to rape you 
and then murder you afterwards. Two weeks ago I thougn 
seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone. If you 
really want to know, I imagined that you had something 

do with the Thought Police.” 

The girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as 

tribute to the excellence of her disguise. . . 

“Not the Thought Police! You didn’t honestly think thatfijr 
“Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your genera 

92 


appearance—merely because you’re young and fresh and 
healthy, you understand—I thought that probably—” 

^ “You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word 
and deed. Banners, processions, slogans, games, community 
hikes—all that stuff. And you thought that if I had a quar¬ 
ter of a chance I’d denounce you as a thought-criminal and 
and get you killed off?” 

“Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are 
like that, you know.” 

“It’s this bloody thing that does it,” she said, ripping off 
the scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex 'League and flinging 
it onto a bough. Then, as though touching her waist had 
reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her over¬ 
alls and produced a smalf slab of chocolate. She broke it in 
half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he 
had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual 
chocolate. It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver 
paper. Chocolate normally was dull-brown crumbly stuff that 
tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a 
rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted 
chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of 
its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin 
down, but which was powerful and troubling. 

“Where did you get this stuff?” he said. 

* “Black market,” she said indifferently. “Actually I am that 
sort of girl, to look at. I’m good at games. I was a troop 
leader in the Spies. I do voluntary work three evenings a 
week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and hours I’ve 
spent pasting their bloody rot all over London. I always carry 
one end of a banner in the processions. I always look cheer¬ 
ful and I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, 
that’s what I say. It’s the only way to be safe.” 

The first fragment of chocolate had melted on Winston’s 
tongue. The taste was delightful. But there was still that mem¬ 
ory moving round the edges of his consciousness, something 
strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape, like an ob¬ 
ject seen out of the corner of one’s eye. He pushed it away 
from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action 
which he would have liked to undo but could not. 

“You are very young,” he said. “You are ten or fifteen 
years younger than I am. What could you see to attract you 
in a man like me?” 

“It was something in your face. I thought I’d take a chance. 
I m good at spotting people who don’t belong. As soon as I 
4 pw you I knew you were against them ” 

Them, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner 

93 


Party, about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred 
which made Winston feel uneasy, although he knew that 
they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere. A thinjf-'jT 
that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her 
language. Party members were supposed not to swear, and 
Winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at any rate. 
Julia, however, seemed unable to mention the Party, and 
especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words 
that you saw chalked up in dripping alleyways. He did not 
dislike it. It was merely one symptom of her revolt against 
the Party and all its ways, and somehow it seemed natural 
and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay. 
They had left the clearing and were wandering again through 
the checkered shade, with their arms round each other’s 
waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He 
noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that 
the sash was gone. They did not speak above a whisper. Out¬ 
side the clearing, Julia said, it was better to go quietly. 
Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. She 
stopped him. 

“Don’t go out into the open. There might be someone 
watching. We’re all right if we keep behind the boughs.” 

They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sun¬ 
light, filtering through innumerable leaves, was still hot on 
their faces. Winston looked out into the field beyond, ang 
underwent a curious, slow shock of recognition. He knew 
it by sight. An old, close-bitten pasture, with a footpath 
wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the 
ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees 
swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred 
faintly in dense masses like women’s hair. Surely somewhere 
near by, but out of sight, there must be a stream with green 

pools where dace were swimming. 

“Isn’t there a stream somewhere near here? he whispered. 

“That’s right, there is a stream. It’s at the edge ° f the nc 
field, actually.-There are fish in it, great big oms. You i can 
watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees, waving 

their tails.” , 

“It’s the Golden Country—almost, he murmured. 

“The Golden Country?” . 5n a 

“It’s nothing, really. A landscape I’ve seen sometimes m a 

dream.” 

"Look!” whispered Julia. 

A thrush had alighted on a bough not five meters away, 
almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen thegfw 
It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out its wings,

fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head for a 
moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, 
^fand then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the after¬ 
noon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and 
Julia clung together, fascinated. The music went on and on, 
minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once 
repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately 
showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped for a few 
seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its 
• . • | again burst into sons. Winston watched 

it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was 
that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What 
made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music 
into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there was a 
microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had onlv 
spoken m low whispers, and it would not pick up what they 
had said but it would pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the 
other end of the instrument some small, beetlelike man was 

of mnX'n y "T. ,Sten,ng t0 th0t ' BUt b y de ? reeS thc

though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him 
f“ d S ot mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the 
leaves. He stopped thinking and merely felt. The girl’s waist 
,h ? »'"&lt;* of his arm was soft and warm. He pulled 
round so that they were breast to breast; her body seemed to 

'ftrelt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yield

“Have you done this before?” 

“Of course. Hundreds of times—well, scores of times, any¬ 
way.” 

“With Party members?” 

“Yes, always with Party members.” 

“With members of the Inner Party?” 

“Not with those swine, no. But there’s plenty that would 
if they got half a chance. They're not so holy as they make 
out.” 

His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it; he wished 
it had been hundreds—thousands. Anything that hinted at 
corruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew? 
Perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult of 
strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing in¬ 
iquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with 
leprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Any¬ 
thing to rot, to weaken, to undermine! He pulled her down 
so that they were kneeling face to face. 

“Listen. The more men you’ve had, the more I love you. 

Do you understand that?” 

“Yes, perfectly.” 

“I hate purity, I hate goodness. I don't want any virtue to 
exist anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones. 

“Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I'm corrupt to the 

bones.” 

“You like doing this? I don’t mean simply me; I mean me 
thing in itself?” 


“I adore it.” , _ . 

That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely 

the love of one person, but the animal instinct, the simple 
undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the 
Party to pieces. He pressed her down upon the grass, among 
the fallen bluebells. This time there was no difficulty. Presently 
the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed, 
and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The sun 
seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He 
reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly 
over her. Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for 

about half an hour. . . . freckled 

Winston woke first. He sat and watched the frecklea 

face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of herha n . 

Except for her mouth, you could not call her beautiful. Th 

was a line or two round the eyes, if you looked closely. 1 

short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft. It occur 

to him that he still did not know her surname or where s^ 

lived.

The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in 
him a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness 
^^iat he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrush was 
singing, had not quite come back. He pulled the overalls aside 
and studied her smooth white flank. In the old days, he 
thought, a man looked at a girl’s body and saw that it was 
desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could 
not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was 
pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. 
Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It 
was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act. 

in 

‘‘We can come here once again,” said Julia. ‘‘It’s generally 
safe to use any hide-out twice. But not for another month or 
two, of course.” 

As soon as she woke up her demeanor had changed. She 
became alert and businesslike, put her clothes on, knotted 
the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging the 
details of the journey home. It seemed natural to leave this 
to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston 
lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge 
of the countryside round London, stored away from in¬ 
numerable community hikes. The route she gave him was 
quite different from the one by which he had come, and 
brought him out at a different railway station. “Never go 
home the same way as you went out,” she said, as though 
enunciating an important general principle. She would leave 
first, and Winston was to wait half an hour before following 
her. 

She had named a place where they could meet after work, 
four evenings hence. It was a street in one of the poorer quar¬ 
ters, where there was an open market which was generally 
crowded and noisy. She would be hanging about among the 
stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing thread. 
If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her 
nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her 
without recognition. But with luck, in the middle of the crowd, 

it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange 
another meeting. ° 

And now I must go,” she said as soon as he had mastered 
his instructions. “I’m due back at nineteen-thirty. I’ve got to 
«ut in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League, handing out 
leaflets, or something. Isn’t it bloody? Give me a brush-down, 

97 


would you. Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are you sure? 
Then good-by, my love, good-by!” 

She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, 
and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and 
disappeared into the wood with very little noise. Even now 
he had not found out her surname or her address. How¬ 
ever, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that 
they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written 
communication. 

As it happened they never went back to the clearing in 
the wood. During the month of May there was only one fur¬ 
ther occasion on which they actually succeeded in making 
love. That was in another hiding place known to Julia, the 
belfry of a ruined church in an almost-deserted stretch of 
country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. 
It was a good hiding place when once you got there, but the 
getting there was very dangerous. For the rest they could 
meet only in the streets, in a different place every evening 
and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the street 
it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted 
down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never 
looking at one another, they carried on a curious, intermittent 
conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a 
lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of 
a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then takdfi 
up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then ab¬ 
ruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then con¬ 
tinued almost without introduction on the following day. 
Julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation, 
which she called “talking by installments.” She was also sur¬ 
prisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once 
in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to ex¬ 
change a kiss. They were passing in silence down a side street 
(Julia would never speak when they were away from the main 
streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved 
and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his 
side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped 
quite near at hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia’s face 
a few centimeters from his own, deathly white, as white as 
chalk. Even her lips were white. She was dead! He clasped 
her against him, and found that he was kissing a live warm 
face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way 
of his lips. Both of their faces were thickly coated with 

1 There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous 
and then had to walk past one another without a sign, bc- 

98 


| cause a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter 
^^vas hovering overhead. Even if it had been less dangerous, 
^fft would still have been difficult to find time to meet. Win¬ 
ston's working week was sixty hours, Julia’s was even longer, 
and their free days varied according to the pressure of work 
and did not often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an 
evening completely free. She spent an astonishing amount of 
time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing 
literature for the Junior Anti-Sex League, preparing banners 
for Hate Week, making collections for the savings campaign, 
and suchlike activities. It paid, she said; it was camouflage. If 
you kept the small rules you could break the big ones. She 
even induced Winston to mortgage yet another of his eve¬ 
nings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition work 
which was done voluntarily by zealous Party members. So, 
one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of paralyz¬ 
ing boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which 
were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a draughty ill-lit work¬ 
shop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with 
the music of the telescreens. 

When they met in the church tower the gaps in their frag¬ 
mentary conversation were filled up. It was a blazing after¬ 
noon. The air in the little square chamber above the bells 
was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon 
dung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered 
floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to 

cast a glance through the arrow slits and make sure that no 
one was coming. 

Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with 
thirty other girls (“Always in the stink of women! How I hate 
women! she said parenthetically), and she worked, as he 
had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the Fiction De¬ 
partment. She enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in 
running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor.

felt at home with machinery. She could describe the whole

dHad disappeared when she was eight. At school she had been 

99 


captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics f 
trophy two years running. She had been a troop leader in the. 
Spies and a branch secretary in the Youth League befon?*V 
joining the Junior Anti-Sex League. She had always borne an 
excellent character. She had even (an infallible mark of good 
reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub¬ 
section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap 
pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nick¬ 
named Muck House by the people who worked in it, she re¬ 
marked. There she had remained for a year, helping to produce 
booklets in sealed packets with titles like Spanking Stones or 
One Night in a Girls’ School, to be bought furtively by prole¬ 
tarian youths who were under the impression that they were 
buying something illegal. 

“What are these books like?” said Winston curiously. 

“Oh, ghastly rubbish. They’re boring, really. They only 
have six plots, but they swap them round a bit. Of course 
I was only on the kaleidoscopes. I was never in the Rewrite 
Squad. I’m not literary, dear—not even enough for that. 

He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Porno¬ 
sec, except the head of the department, were girls. The theory 
was that men, whose sex instincts were less controllable than 
those of women, were in greater danger of being corrupted 

by the filth they handled. „ . 

“They don’t even like having married women there, sop 
added. “Girls are always supposed to be so pure. Here s one

like her there might be in the younger generation—people 
who had grown up in the world of the Revolution, knowing 
v ^nothing else, accepting the Party as something unalterable, 
like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply 
evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog. 

They did not discuss the possibility of getting married. It 
was too remote to be worth thinking about. No imaginable 
committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if Kath¬ 
arine, Winston’s wife, could somehow have been got rid of. 
It was hopeless even as a daydream. 

“What was she like, your wife?” said Julia. 

“She was—do you know the Nevvspeak work good think ful? 
Meaning naturally orthodox, incapable of thinking a bad 
thought?” 

“No, I didn’t know the word, but I know the kind of per¬ 
son, right enough.” 

He began telling her the story of his married life, but 
curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of 
it already. She described to him, almost as though she had 
seen or felt it, the stiffening of Katharine’s body as soon as 
he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to be push¬ 
ing him from her with all her strength, even when her arms 
were clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt no difficulty 
in talking about such things; Katharine, in any case, had long 
^eased to be a painful memory and become merely a distastc- 
*-iul one. 


M 


“I could have stood it if it hadn’t been for one thing,” he 
said. He told her about the frigid little ceremony that Katha¬ 
rine had forced him to go through on the same night every 
week. “She hated it, but nothing would make her stop doing 
it. She used to call it—but you’ll never guess.” 

“Our duty to the Party,” said Julia promptly. 

‘How did you know that?” 

I ve been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for 
the over-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement. They rub it 
into you for years. I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But of 
course you can never tell; people are such hvpocrites.” 

She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, every- 
thmg came back to her own sexuality. As soon as this was 
touched upon m any way she was capable of great acuteness. 
Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the 
Party s sexual puntanism. It was not merely that the sex 
instinct created a world of its own which was outside the 

^•5 C ?, n ,! ro and which the refore had to be destroyed if 

/ S' Was ,m P° rtant was that sexual privation 
Hnduced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be 

101 


transformed into war fever and leader worship. The way she 
put it was: 

"When you make love you’re using up energy; and after-. 
wards you feel happy and don’t give a damn for anything. 
Thev can’t bear you to feel like that. They want you to be 
bursting with energy all the time. All this marching up and 
down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. 

If you’re happy inside yourself, why should you get excited 
about Big Brother and the Three-Year Plans and the Two 
Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?” 

That was very true, he thought. There was a direct, intimate 
connection between chastity and political orthodoxy. For 
how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulity which 
the Party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch 
except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using 
it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the 
Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had 
played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. The 
family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people 
were encouraged to be fond of their children in almost the 
old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, were 
systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy 
on them and report their deviations. The family had become 
in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was a device 
by means of which everyone could be surrounded night ancj^ 
day by informers who knew him intimately. . 

Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine 
would unquestionably have denounced him to the thought 
Police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the 

unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled her to 
him at this moment was the stifling heat of the a f“™°° n - 
which had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He bega 
telling Julia of something that had happened, or rather haci 
[ailed to happen, on another sweltering summer afternoon, 

e, 7t e wa y s e t£ee S °or four months after they were married. They

became very uneasy. To be away fr °"\ f wr y ong doing. 
hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling £ a nW 

She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come 

102 


start searching in the other direction. But at this moment 
Winston noticed some tufts of loose-strife growing in the 
i *cracks of the cliff beneath them. One tuft was of two colors, 
magenta and brick red, apparently growing on the same root. 
He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called 
to Katharine to come and look at it. 

“Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump down 
near the bottom. Do you see they’re two different colors?” 

She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully 
come back for a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff 
face to see where he was pointing. He was standing a little 
behind her, and he put his hand on her waist to steady her. 
At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely 
alone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, 
not a leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like this 
the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very 
small, and even if there was a microphone it would only pick 
up sounds. It was the hottest, sleepiest hour of the afternoon. 
The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his face. 
And the thought struck him. . . . 

“Why didn't you give her a good shove?” said Julia. “I 
would have.” 


“Yes, dear, you would have. I would have, if I’d been the 

same person then as I am now. Or perhaps I would—I'm not 
pertain.” 

“Are you sorry you didn’t?” 

“Yes. On the whole I'm sorry I didn’t.” 

They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. He pulled 
her closer against him. Her head rested on his shoulder, the 
pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung. She 
was v cry young, he thought, she still expected something from 
me, she did not understand that to push an inconvenient per¬ 
son over a cliff solves nothing. 

“Actually it would have made no difference.” he said.

w as luck and cunning and boldness. She did not understand | 
that there was no such thing as happiness, that the only victory 1 
lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from the’ 

moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think I 
ot yourself as a corpse. 

“We are the dead,” he said. 

We re not dead yet,” said Julia prosaically. 

Not physically. Six months, a year—five years, conceiv- ' 
ably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably , 
you re more afraid of it than I am. Obviously vve shall put it ' 
o ff as l° n S a s can. But it makes very little difference. So j 
long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same 
thing.” 

Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or ! 
a skeleton? Don't you enjoy being alive? Don't you like feel¬ 
ing: This is me, this is my hand, this is my leg, I’m real, I’m ! 
solid. I’m alive! Don’t you like this?” 

She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against 
him. He could feel her breasts, ripe yet firm, through her 
overalls. Her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth 
and vigor into his. 1 

“Yes, I like that,” he said. j 

“Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear, 
we’ve got to fix up about the next time we meet. We may as 
well go back to the place in the wood. We’ve given it a good 
long rest. But you must get there by a different way this 
time. I’ve got it all planned out. You take the train—but look, 

I’ll draw it out for you.” j 

And in her practical way she scraped together a small 
square of dust, and with a twig from a pigeon’s nest began 
drawing a map on the floor. • 1

Winston looked around the shabby little room above Mr. i 
Charrington’s shop. Beside the window the enormous bed 
was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster. 

The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was tick¬ 
ing away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg 
table, the glass paperweight which he had bought on his last 
visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness. I 

In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan and 

two cups, provided by Mr. Charrington. Winston lit the [ 

burner and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought »*i 
envelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets.

The clock’s hands said seven-twenty; it was nineteen-twenty 
^ really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty. 

Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, 
suicidal folly! Of all the crimes that a Party member could 
commit, this one was the least possible to conceal. Actually 
the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision 
oi the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the 
gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr. Charrington had made 
no difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad 
of the few dollars that it would bring him. Nor did he seem 
shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made 
clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love 
affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke 
in generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impres¬ 
sion that he had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, 
was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place where 
they could be alone occasionally. And when they had such a 
place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew 
of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming al¬ 
most to fade out of existence as he did so, added that there 
were two entries to the house, one of them through the back¬ 
yard, which gave on an alley. 

Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped 
out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain. The June 
^un was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled court below 
a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman pillar, with brawnv 
red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle, 
was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothesline

and the cries of the children in the street, and somewhere in 
the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the room seemed 
curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen. 

Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable 
that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks 
without being caught. But the temptation of having a hiding 
place that was truly their own, indoors and near at hand, had 
been too much for both of them. For some time after their 
visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange 
meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in 
anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, 
but the enormous, complex preparations that it entailed were 
throwing extra work onto everybody. Finally both of them 
managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day. They 
had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the 
evening beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual 
Winston hardly looked at Julia as they drifted toward one 
another in the crowd, but from the short glance he gave her 
it seemed to him that she was paler than usual. 

“It’s all off,” she murmured as soon as she judged it safe 
to speak. “Tomorrow, I mean.” 

“What?” 

“Tomorrow afternoon. I can't come.” 

“Why not?” 

“Oh, the usual reason. It’s started early this time.” t 

For a moment he was violently angry. During the month 
that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had 
changed. At the beginning there had been little true sensu¬ 
ality in it. Their first love-making had been simply an act of 
the will. But after the second time it was different. The smell 
of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin 
seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. 
She had become a physical necessity, something that he not 
only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she said 
that she could not come, he had the feeling that she was 
cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed 
them together and their hands accidentally met. She ga 
the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to &gt;n v &gt; 
not desire but affection. It struck him that when one lived 
with a woman this particular disappointment must be a nor¬ 
mal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had 
not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wishe 
that they were a married couple of ten years standing, 
wished that he were walking through the s * reet * w, * h fp , r 
just as they were doing now, but openly and without teat* 
talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the house 

106 



hold. He wished above all that they had some place where 
* they could be alone together without feeling the obligation 
to make love every time they met. It was not actually at that 
moment, but at some time on the following day, that the idea 
of renting Mr. Charrington’s room had occurred to him. 
When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected 
readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as 
though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. 
As he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again 
of the cellars of the Ministry of Love. It was curious how 
that predestined horror moved in and out of one’s conscious¬ 
ness. There it lay, fixed in future time, preceding death as 
surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one 
could perhaps postpone it; and yet instead, every now and 
again, by a conscious, willful act, one chose to shorten the 
interval before it happened. 

At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia 
burst into the room. She was carrying a tool bag of coarse 
brown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying 
to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward to take her 
in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, 
partly because she was still holding the tool bag. 

“Half a second,” she said. “Just let me show you what I've 
brought. Did you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? 
*1 thought you would. You can chuck it away again, because 
we shan’t be needing it. Look here.” 

She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out 
some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. 
Underneath was a number of neat paper packets. The first 
packet that she passed to Winston had a strange and yet 
vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of 
heavy, sandlike stuff which yielded wherever you touched it. 

“It isn't sugar?” he said. 

“Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here’s a loaf of 
bread—proper white bread, not our bloody stuff—and a little 
pot of jam. And here’s a tin of milk—but look! This is the 
one I m really proud of. I had to wrap a bit of sacking round 
it, because—” 


But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up 

The smell was already filling the room, a rich hot smell which 

seemed like an emanation from his early childhood, but 

which one did occasionally meet with even now, blowing 

down a passageway before a door slammed, or diffusing itself 

mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and 
flthen lost again. 

“It’s coffee,” he murmured, “real coffee.” 


107 


“It’s Inner Party coffee. There’s a whole kilo here,” she 
said. 

“How did you manage to get hold of all these things?” 

It s all Inner Party stuff. There’s nothing those swine don’t 
have, nothing. But of course waiters and servants and people 
. pinch things, and—look, I got a little packet of tea as well.” 

Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a 
corner of the packet. 

"It’s real tea. Not blackberry leaves.” 

"There’s been a lot of tea about lately. They’ve captured 
India, or something,” she said vaguely. “But listen, dear. I 
want you to turn your back on me for three minutes. Go and 
sit on the other side of the bed. Don’t go too near the window. 
And don't turn round till I tell you.” 

Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. 
Down in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching 
to and fro between the washtub and the line. She took two 
more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling: 

"They sye that time ’eals all things, 

They sye you can always forget; 

But the smiles an’ the tears acrorss the years 
They twist my ’eartstrings yet!” 

She knew the whole driveling song by heart, it seemed. Her 
voice floated upward with the sweet summer air, very tune¬ 
ful, charged with a sort of happy melancholy. One had the 
feeling that she would have been perfectly content if the June 
evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inex¬ 
haustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out 
diapers and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact 
that he had never heard a member of the Party singing alone 
and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly unor¬ 
thodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself. Per¬ 
haps it was only when people were somewhere near the starva¬ 
tion level that they had anything to sing about. 

“You can turn round now,” said Julia. 

He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recog¬ 
nize her. What he had actually expected was to see her naked. 
But she was not naked. The transformation that had happened 
was much more surprising than that. She had painted her 
face. 

She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian 
quarters and bought herself a complete set of makeup mate¬ 
rials. Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, he$ 
nose powdered; there was even a touch of something under 

108 



the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skillfully 
done, but Winston’s standards in such matters were not high. 
He had never before seen or imagined a woman of the Party 
with cosmetics on her face. The improvement in her appear¬ 
ance was startling. With just a few dabs of color in the right 
places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above 
all, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls 
merely added to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave 
of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils. He remembered the 
half-darkness of a basement kitchen and a woman’s cavernous 
mouth. It was the very same scent that she had used; but at 
the moment it did not seem to matter. 

“Scent, too!” he said. 


“Yes, dear, scent, too. And do you know what I’m going 
to do next? I’m going to get hold of a real woman’s frock 
from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers. 
I’ll wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this room 
I’m going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.” 

They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge ma¬ 
hogany bed. It was the first time that he had stripped himself 
naked in her presence. Until now he had been too much 
ashamed of his pale and meager body, with the varicose 
veins standing out on his calves and the discolored patch over 
his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on 
was threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of 
the bed astonished both of them. “It’s sure to be full of bugs, 
but who cares?’ said Julia. One never saw a double bed 
nowadays except in the homes of the proles. Winston had oc¬ 
casionally slept in one in his boyhood; Julia had never been 
in one before, so far as she could remember. 

Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston 
woke up the hpnds of the clock had crept round to nearly 

™ e ; . e d,d not st, r. because Julia was sleeping with her 
head , n the crook of his arm. Most of her make-up had 
transferred itself to his own face of the bolster, but a ? light 

AvellowTf 5 brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. 
hJ inH r Z f ™ m t! ? e smkm g sun fell across the foot of the 
?" dllgh . ted U P the fireplace, where the water in the pan

had h^n “° d , d Vaguely whether in the abolished past it 
had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this in the 


109 


have been a time when that seemed ordinary. Julia woke up, 
rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at •-* 
the oilstove. 

“Half that water’s boiled away,” she said. “I’ll get up and 
make some coffee in another moment. We've got an hour. 
What time do they cut the lights off at your flats?” 

“Twenty-three thirty.” 

“It's twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in 
earlier than that, because— Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!” 

She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe 
from the floor, and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boy¬ 
ish jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her fling the dic¬ 
tionary at Goldstein, that morning during the Two Minutes 
Hate. 

“What was it?” he said in surprise. 

“A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wains¬ 
coting. There’s a hole down there. I gave him a good fright, 
anyway.” 

“Rats!” murmured Winston. “In this room!" 

‘They're all over the place,” said Julia indifferently as she 
lay down again. “We’ve even got them in the kitchen at the 
hostel. Some parts of London are swarming with them. Did 
you know they attack children? Yes, they do. In some of these 
streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for two minutes.^. 
It’s the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nasty thing 

is that the brutes always—” 

"Don't go on!" said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut. 

“Dearest! You’ve gone quite pale. What’s the matter? Do 

they make you feel sick?” 

“Of all horrors in the world—a rat!” 

She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs 
round him, as though to reassure him with the warmth of her 
body. He did not reopen his eyes immediately. For several 
moments he had had the feeling of being back in a nightmare 
which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It 
was always very much the same. He was standing in front o 
a wall of darkness, and on the other side of it there was some¬ 
thing unendurable, something too dreadful to be faced. In 
the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self-decep¬ 
tion, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall 
of darkness. With a deadly cfTort, like wrenching a piece out 
of his own brain, he could even have dragged the thing into 
the open. He always woke up without discovering what it was, 
but somehow it was connected with what Julia had been say¬ 
ing when he cut her short. 


110 


“I’m sorry,” he said. “It’s nothing. I don’t like rats, that’s all.” 

“Don’t worry, dear, we’re not going to have the filthy 
brutes in here. I’ll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before 
we go. And next time we come here I’ll bring some plaster 
and bung it up properly.” 

Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feel¬ 
ing slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bed¬ 
head. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and made 
the coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan was so 
powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybodv 
outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was 
even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture 
given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten 
after years of saccharine. With one hand in her pocket and 
a piece of bread and jam in the other, Julia wandered about 
the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase, pointing out 
the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself 
down in the ragged armchair to see if it was comfortable, 
and examining the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of 
tolerant amusement. She brought the glass paperweight’ over 
to the bed to have a look at it in a better light. He took it out 
of her hand, fascinated as always by the soft, rainwatery ap¬ 
pearance of the glass. 

“What is it, do you think?” said Julia. 

V don&gt;t * h 'nk it’s anything—I mean, I don’t think it was 
ever put to any use. That’s what I like about it. It’s a little 
chunk of history that they’ve forgotten to alter. It’s a message 
from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it.” 

“And that picture over there—” she nodded at the cngrav- 
mg ? on the opposite wall—“would that be a hundred years 


“More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can’t tell. It’s im¬ 
possible to discover the age of anything nowadays.”

To his astonishment she capped the line:

nen will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey _ 

111 


“I can’t remember how it goes on after that. But anyway I 
remember it ends up. Here comes a candle to light you to bed, 
here comes a chopper to chop off your head!” 

It was like the two halves of a countersign. But there must 
be another line after the bells of Old Bailey. Perhaps it could 
be dug out of Mr. Charrington’s memory, if he were suitably 
prompted. 

“Who taught you that?” he said. 

“My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a 
little girl. He was vaporized when I was eight—at any rate, he 
disappeared. I wonder what a lemon was,” she added incon- 
sequently. “I’ve seen oranges. They're a kind of round yellow 
fruit with a thick skin.” 

"I can remember lemons,” said Winston. “They were quite 
common in the Fifties. They were so sour that it set your 

teeth on edge even to smell them.” _ 

“I bet that picture’s got bugs behind it,” said Julia. 1 ll 
take it down and give it a good cleaning some day. I suppose 
it’s almost time we were leaving. I must start washing this 
paint off. What a bore! I'll get the lipstick off your face after¬ 


wards.” . . r , __ 

Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The room 

was darkening. He turned over toward the light and lay gazing 

into the glass paperweight. The inexhaustibly interesting thing 

was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass, 

itself. There was such a depth of it and yet it was almost 

transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass 

had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a "£*,2 

atmosphere complete. He had the feeling *at he ^ould get 
inside it, and that in fact he was inside it, along with the m 
hogany bed and the gateleg table and the clock and the stce 
engraving and the paperweight itself. The paperweight 
“e rcXYe was in, and the coral was Julia's life and h,s own, 
fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal. 


Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missig 
from work; a few thoughtless people oommented^on h.s^ 

sence. On the next day nobody ,1 JTwords Depart-

whom Syme had been one. It looked almost.exacty 

looked before—nothing had been crossed out-but 


name shorter. It was enough. Syme had ceased to exist; he 
had never existed. 

The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry 
the windowless, air-conditioned rooms kept their normal tem¬ 
perature, but outside the pavements scorched one’s feet and 
the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was a horror. The 
preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and the staffs 
of all the Ministries were working overtime. Processions, 
meetings, military parades, lectures, waxwork displays, film 
shows, telescreen programs all had to be organized; stands 
had to be erected, effigies built, slogans coined, songs written, 
rumors circulated, photographs faked. Julia’s unit in the Fic¬ 
tion Department had been taken off the production of novels 
and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets. Winston, 
«n addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day 
m going through back files of the Times and altering and em¬ 
bellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches. 
Late at night, when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the 
streets the town had a curiously febrile air. The rocket bombs 
crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance 
there were enormous explosions which no one could explain 
and about which there were wild rumors. 

The new tune which was to be the theme song of Hate 
Week (the Hate Song,” it was called) had already been 
composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens. 
It had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly be 

out bvZnLH Ut r f esembled th f beatin § of a drum. Roared 
by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it 

was terrifying. The proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the

had no caption, and represented simply the monstrous figure 
of a Eurasian soldier, three or four meters high, striding for¬ 
ward with expressionless Mongolian face and enormous boots,' 
a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whatever angle 
you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified 
by the foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. 
The thing had been plastered on every blank space on every 
wall, even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother. The 
proles, normally apathetic about the war, were being lashed 
into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism. As though 
to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had 
been killing larger numbers of people than usual. One fell on 
a crowded film theater in Stepney, burying several hundred 
victims among the ruins. The whole population of the neigh¬ 
borhood turned out for a long, trailing funeral which went on 
for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting. Another 
bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a 
playground, and several dozen children were blown to pieces. 
There were further angry demonstrations, Goldstein was 
burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the poster of the 
Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and 


a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumor 
flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by 
means of wireless waves, and an old couple who were sus¬ 
pected of being of foreign extraction had their house set oi^ 

fire and perished of suffocation. - 

In the room over Mr. Charrington’s shop, when they could 
get there, Julia and Winston lay side by side on a stripped 
bed under the open window, naked for the sake of coolnca. 
The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied 
hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or 
clean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived 
would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the biacx 
market, tear off their clothes and make love with sweating 
bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs naa 
rallied and were massing for the counterattack. 

Four, five, six—seven times they met during the month oi 
June. Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at ai 
hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He had grown 
fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only a brown 
stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing m the 
early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased 

be intolerable, he had no longer any k im P uls ^/ 0 h ^ a v k o e f ce faC N 0 w

that they had a secure hiding place, almost a home it did no^ 

nen seem a hardship that they could only meet ^frequently 

114 


and for a couple of hours at a time. What mattered was that 
the room over the junk shop should exist. To know that it 
•was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The 
room was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals 
could walk. Mr. Charrington, thought Winston, was another 
extinct animal. He usually stopped to talk with Mr. Charring¬ 
ton for a few minutes on his way upstairs. The old man seemed 
seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other hand to 
have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence be¬ 
tween the tiny, dark shop and an even tinier back kitchen 
where he prepared his meals and which contained, among 

an unbelievably ancient grammophone with an 
enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity to talk. 
Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long 
nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the 
velvet jacket, he had always vaguely the air of being a col¬ 
lector rather than a tradesman. With a sort of faded enthusi¬ 


asm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that—a china 
bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snufT-box, a pinch¬ 
beck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby's 
hair never asking that Winston should buy it, merely that 
he should admire it. To talk to him was like listening to the 
tinkling of a worn-out musical box. He had dragged out from 
the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten 
rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, 
*md another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another 
about the death of poor Cock Robin. "It just occurred to me 
you might be interested," he would say with a deprecating 
little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment. But he 
coiiid never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme. 

Both of them knew—in a way, it was never out of their 
minds that what was now happening could not last long. 

I here were times when the fact of impending death seemed 
as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling 
together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned 
oul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is 
five , m » n ut es of striking. But there were also times

Juck ^ould^hofd^fT ff ^ eS i Up t0 daydreams of escape. Their 
luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their 


115 



intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. 
Or Katharine would die, and by subtle maneuverings Winston 
and Julia would succeed in getting married. Or they would*- 
commit suicide together. Or they would disappear, alter them¬ 
selves out of recognition, learn to speak with proletarian ac¬ 
cents, get jobs in a factory, and live out their lives undetected 
in a back street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In 
reality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was 
practicable, suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. To 
hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning 
out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable 
instinct, just as one’s lungs will always draw the next breath 
so long as there is air available. 

Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion 
against the Party, but with no notion of how to take the first 
step. Even if the fabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there 
still remained the difficulty of finding one's way into it. He 
told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed to 
exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of the impulse he 


sometimes felt simply to walk into O Bricn’s presence, an¬ 
nounce that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his 
help. Curiously enough this did not strike her as an impossibly 
rash thing to do. She was used to judging people by their 
faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston should believe 
O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of 
the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or 
nearly everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break 
the rules if he thought it safe to do so. But she refused to 
believe that widespread, organized opposition existed or could 
exist. The tales about Goldstein and his underground army, 
she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party had 
invented for its own purposes and which you had to' P rete "“ 
to believe in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and 
spontaneous demonstrations, she bad shouted at thc 
her voice for the execution of people whose names she n 
never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not me 
faintest belief. When public trials were h ®PP^*"f h s J e _ a ^ e 
taken her place in the detachments from the Youth 
who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting 
at intervals “Death to the traitors! During the Two M 
Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults; at Gold 
stein Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Golds

side her imagination; and in any case the Party was invincible. 
^It would always exist, and it would always be the same. You 
could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or, at most, 
by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or 
blowing something up. 

In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and 
far less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he hap¬ 
pened in some connection to mention the war against Eurasia, 
she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the 
war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily 
on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania 
itself, “just to keep people frightened.” This was an idea that 
had literally never occurred to him. She also stirred a sort of 
envy in him by telling him that during the Two Minutes Hate 
her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing. But 
she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they 
in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready 
to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference 
between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her. 
She believed, for instance, having learnt it at school, that the 
Party had invented airplanes. (In his own schooldays, Winston 
remembered, in the late Fifties, it was only the helicopter that 
the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later, when 
Julia was at school, it was already claiming the airplane; one 
^generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) 
And when he told her that airplanes had been in existence 
before he was born, and long before the Revolution, the fact 
struck her as totally uninteresting. After all, what did it 
matter who had invented airplanes? It was rather more of a 
shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark 
that she did not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had 
been at war with Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia. It was

and the impudent forgeries that he committed there. Such 
things did not appear to horrify her. She did not feel the 
abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becom-* 
ing truths. He told her the story of Jones. Aaronson, and 
Rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had 
once held between his fingers. It did not make much impres¬ 
sion on her. At first, indeed, she failed to grasp the point of 
the story. 

“Were they friends of yours?” she said. 

“No, I never knew them. They were Inner Party members. 
Besides, they were far older men than I was. They belonged 
to the old days, before the Revolution. I barely knew them 
by sight.” 

“Then what was there to worry about? People are being 
killed off all the time, aren't they?” 

He tried to make her understand. “This was an exceptional 


case. It wasn’t just a question of somebody being killed. Do 
you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been 
actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid 
objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of 
glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about 
the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every 
record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been 
rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and 
street and building has been renamed, every date has been 
altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute 
by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an 
endless present in which the Party is always right. I know ot 
course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible 
for me to prove it. even when I did the falsification m&gt; sell. 
After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only 
evidence is inside mv own mind, and I don’t know with any 
certainty that any other human being shares my memories. 
Just in that one instance, in my whole life. I did possess actu 
concrete evidence after the event—years after it.

of resistance springing up here and there—small groups of 
♦.people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, 
and even leaving a few records behind, so that the next gen¬ 
eration can carry on where we leave off.” 

"I’m not interested in the next generation, dear. I’m inter¬ 
ested in us.” 

“You’re only a rebel from the waist downwards,” he told 
her. 


She thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round 
him in delight. 

In the ramifications of Party doctrine she had not the 
faintest interest. Whenever he began to talk of the principles 
of Ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past and the 
denial of objective reality, and to use Nevvspcak words, she 
became bored and confused and said that she never paid 
any attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was all 
rubbish, so why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when 
to cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed. If 
he persisted in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcert¬ 
ing habit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who 
can go to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking to her, 
he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of ortho¬ 
doxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy 
meant. In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself 
•^most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. 
They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of

O’Brien 8 stopped abruptly and turned. It was 


119 


At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only 
impulse was to run away. His heart bounded violently. He^ 
would have been incapable of speaking. O’Brien, however, had 
continued forward in the same movement, laying a friendly 
hand for a moment on Winston’s arm, so that the two of 
them were walking side by side. He began speaking with the 
peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the ma¬ 
jority of Inner Party members. 

“I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,” 
he said. “I was reading one of your Newspcak articles in the 
Times the other day. You take a scholarly interest in New- 
speak, I believe?” 

Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. ‘‘Hardly 
scholarly,” he said. “I'm only an amateur. It’s not my sub¬ 
ject. I have never had anything to do with the actual con¬ 
struction of the language.” 

“But you write it very elegantly,” said O'Brien. “That is 
not only my own opinion. I was talking recently to a friend 
of yours who is certainly an expert. His name has slipped my 
memory for the moment.” 

Again Winston’s heart stirred painfully. It was inconceiv¬ 
able that this was anything other than a reference to Syme. 
But Syme was not only dead, he was abolished, an unperson. 
Any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally 
dangerous. O'Brien’s remark must obviously have been ln^. 
tended as a signal, a code word. By sharing a small act of 
thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices. 
They had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor, but 
now O'Brien halted. With the curious, disarming friendliness 
that he always managed to put into the gesture, he resettled i? 

spectacles on his nose. Then he went on: 

“What I had really intended to say was that in your article 
I noticed you had used two words which have become ob¬ 
solete. But they have only become so very recently. Have you 
seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak dictionary. 

“No,” said Winston. “I didn’t think it had been issued yet. 
We are still using the ninth in the Records Department. 

“The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, 
I believe. But a few advance copies have been circulated. I 
have one myself. It might interest you to look at it,• P crh *P*‘ 
“Very much so,” said Winston, immediately seeing where 

thi “Sorne ^f the new developments are most ingenious. The 
reduction in-the number of verbs-tha. is .he pom. .ha. w.H 
anneal to you, I think. Let me see, shall I send a messer 
to you with the dictionary? But I am afraid I invariably for- 

120 




get anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up at 
my flat at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give you 
^my address.” 

They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat 
absent-mindedly O’Brien felt two of his pockets and then 
produced a small leather-covered notebook and a gold ink 
pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in such a position 
that anyone who was watching at the other end of the in¬ 
strument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an 
address, tore out the page, and handed it to Winston. 

“I am usually at home in the evenings,” he said. “If not, 
my servant will give you the dictionary.” 

He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, 
which this time there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless 
he carefully memorized what was written on it, and some 
hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a 
mass of other papers. 

They had been talking to one another for a couple of min¬ 
utes at the most. There was only one meaning that the episode 
could possibly have. It had been contrived as a way of letting 
Winston know O’Brien’s address. This was necessary, because 
except by direct inquiry it was never possible to discover 
where anyone lived. There were no directories of any kind. 
“If you ever want to see me, this is where I can be found,” 
.^jvas what O’Brien had been saying to him. Perhaps there 
would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dic¬ 
tionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. The conspiracy 
that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer 
edges of it. 


He knew that sooner or later he would obey O’Brien’s 
summons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay— 
he was not certain. What was happening was only the work¬ 
ing-out of a process that had started years ago. The first step 
had been a secret, involuntary thought; the second had been 
the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to 
words, and now from words to actions. The last step was 
something that would happen in the Ministry of Love. He 
had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning. But

VII 


Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Julia 
rolled sleepily against him, murmuring something that might 

have been "What's the matter?” 

"I dreamt—” he began, and stopped short. It was too com¬ 
plex to be put into words. There was the dream itself, and 
there was a memory connected with it that had swum into 
his mind in the few seconds after waking. 

He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmos¬ 
phere of the dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which 
his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a land¬ 
scape on a summer evening after rain. It had all occurred 
inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass was 
the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was 
flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into in¬ 
terminable distances. The dream had also been comprehended 
by—indeed, in some sense it had consisted in—a gesture ot 
the arm made by his mother, and made again thirty years later 
by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film, trying to 
shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopters 


blew them both to pieces. .... , f • 

"Do you know,” he said, “that until this moment I be¬ 
lieved I had murdered my mother?” . 

"Why did you murder her?” said Julia, almost asleep. v . 

"I didn’t murder her. Not physically.” 

In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his 
mother, and within a few moments of waking the clust ® r ° 
small events surrounding it had all comeback It 
ory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his 

ness over many years. He was not certam of the da e, but he 
could not have been less than ten years old, poss.bly twelve, 

when it had happened. __ rlier - h 0 w much

in waiting for the passing of trucks which traveled over a 
^certain route and were known to carry cattle feed, and which, 
when they jolted over the bad patches in the road, some¬ 
times spilt a few fragments of oilcake. 

When his father disappeared, his mother did not show any 
surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change came over 
her. She seemed to have become completely spiritless. It was 
evident even to Winston that she was waiting for something 
that she knew must happen. She did everything that was 
needed—cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the 
floor, dusted the mantelpiece—always very slowly and with 
a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an artist’s lay-figure 
moving of its own accord. Her large shapely body seemed to 
relapse naturally into stillness. For hours at a time she would 
sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sistci, a 
tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made 
simian by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Win¬ 
ston in her arms and press him against her for a long time with¬ 
out saying anything. He was aware, in spite of his youthful¬ 
ness and selfishness, that this was somehow connected with 
the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen. 

He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close- 
smelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white 
counterpane. There was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelf 
♦where food was kept, and on the landing outside there was a 
brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He re¬ 
membered his mother’s statuesque body bending over the gas 
ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above all he remem¬ 
bered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles at

The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to fustify him 

123 




Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was 
constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf.^ 
One day a chocolate ration was issued. There had been no 
such issue for weeks or months past. He remembered quite 
clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. It was a two- 
ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days) be¬ 
tween the three of them. It was obvious that it ought to be 
divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were 
listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demand¬ 
ing in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole 
piece. His mother told him not to be greedy. There was a 
long, nagging argument that went round and round, with 
shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny 
sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a 
baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, 
mournful eyes. In the end his mother broke off three-quar¬ 
ters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston, giving the other 
quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold of it and looked 
at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winston stood 
watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring 
he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister s hand 


and was fleeing for the door. 

“Winston, Winston!” his mother called after him. Come 

back! Give your sister back her chocolate!” 

He stopped, but he did not come back. His mother * 
anxious eyes were fixed on his face. Even now she was think¬ 
ing about the thing, he did not know what it was, that was on 
the point of happening. His sister, conscious o having been 
robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother 
drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her 
breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sister ™ 
dying. He turned and fled down the stairs, with the chocolate 

^ n n 8 e«; Ck s^^ 5 m h o a ,h d er again. After he had devoured the 

chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed °f..h™ se ' f ? nd vc h ^ 
about in the streets for several hours, until hunger dro\c n m

i£ " uj Wirt or she might have

been sent to the labor camp along with his mother, or simply 
left somewhere or other to die. 

The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the en¬ 
veloping, protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole 
meaning seemed to be contained. His mind went back to 
another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother had 
sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to 
her, so .she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him 
and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking up at him 
through the darkening water. 

He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance. With¬ 
out opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into 
a more comfortable position. 

“I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,” she 
said indistinctly. ‘‘All children are swine." 


“Yes. But the real point of the story—” 

. From her breathing it was evident that she was going oft 
to sleep again. He would have liked to continue talking about 
his mother. He did not suppose, from what he could re¬ 
member of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still 
less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of 
nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that 
she obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own, 
and could not be altered from outside. It would not have oc¬ 
curred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby be¬ 
comes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved him, and 
when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. 
When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had 
clasped the child in her arms. It was no use, it changed noth- 
I! ??i }} not produce more chocolate, it did not avert the 
child s death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to do it.

embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have 
value in itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had 
remained in this condition. They were not loyal to a party or 
a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. For the 
first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of 
them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to 
life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed human. 
They had not become hardened inside. They had held onto 
the primitive emotions which he himself had to relearn by 
conscious effort. And in thinking this he remembered, without 
apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a sev¬ 
ered hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the 
gutter as though it had been a cabbage stalk. 

“The proles are human beings,” he said aloud. ‘ We are 

not human.” 

“Why not?” said Julia, who had woken up again. 

He thought for a little while. “Has it ever occurred to you, ’ 
he said, “that the best thing for us to do would be simply to 
walk out of here before it’s too late, and never see each other

^“Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I m 

not going to do it, all the same.” 

“We’ve been lucky,” he said, “but it can t last much longer.

could make me stop loving you—that would be the real be- 

tra She thought it over. “They can't do that,” she said finally. 
“It’s the one thing they can’t do. They can makc you a 
anything— anything —but they cant make you believe it. 

They can’t get inside you.” 

“No ” he said a little more hopefully, “no; that s qui.c tiu . 
They can't get inside you. If you can feel that staying hutnnn 
is worth while, even when it cant have any result whatever, 

you’ve beaten them.” . . . 

He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ea.. 

They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your 
head you could still outwit them. With all them cleverness 
they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another 
human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true when 
you were actually in their hands. One did not know what hap¬ 
pened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to guess: 
tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that registered your 
nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and 
solitude and persistent questioning. Facts, at any rate, could 
not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down by inquiry, 
they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the oh- 
ject was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference 
did it ultimately make? They could not alter your feelings, 
for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you 
wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything 
that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, 
whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained 
impregnable. 


VIII 

They had done it, they had done it at last! 

The room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly 
lit. The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the rich¬ 
ness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of tread¬ 
ing on velvet. At the far end of the room O’Brien was sitting 
at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of papers 
on either side of him. He had not bothered to look up when 
the servant showed Julia and Winston in. 

Winston’s heart was thumping so hard that he doubted 
whether he would be able to speak. They had done it, they 
had done it at last, was all he could think. It had been a rash 
act to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together; 
though it was true that they had come by different routes and 
fonly met on O’Brien’s doorstep. But merely to walk into such 

127 



a place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on very 
rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling places of the 
Inner Party, or even penetrated into the quarter of the town f 
where they lived. The whole atmosphere of the huge block 
of flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything, the un¬ 
familiar smells of good food and good tobacco, the silent 
and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white- 
jacketed servants hurrying to and fro—everything was in¬ 
timidating. Although he had a good pretext for coming here, 
he was haunted at every step by the fear that a black-uni¬ 
formed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner, 
demand his papers, and order him to get out. O Brien s serv¬ 
ant, however, had admitted the two of them without demur. 
He was a small, dark-haired man in a white jacket, with a 
diamond-shaped, completely expressionless face which might 
have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which he led 
them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white 
wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That too was intimidating. 
Winston could not remember ever to have seen a passageway 
whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies. 

O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed 
to be studying it intently. His heavy face, bent down so that 
one could see the line of the nose, looked both formidable 
and intelligent. For perhaps twenty seconds he sat w,tb ° u * 
stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite toward him and rapped^ 
out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries: 

“Items one comma five comma seven approved fulh 
stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verg- 

ing crimethink cancel stop unproceed c 0 " 51 ™ 01 '™'™*.

Sa He rose deliberately from his chair and came toward them 

across the soundless carpet. A little of the official at ™“P* er £ 
seemed to have fallen away from him with the Nowspeak 
words but his expression was grimmer than usual, as thoug

turned aside, and pressed a switch on the wall. There was a 
^ sharp snap. The voice had stopped. 

* Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. 
Even in the midst of his panic, Winston was too much taken 
aback to be able to hold his tongue. 

“You can turn it off!” he said. 

“Yes,” said O’Brien, “we can turn it off. We have that priv¬ 
ilege.” . 

He was opposite them now. His solid form towered o\cr 

the pair of them, and the expression on his face was still in¬ 
decipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for Win¬ 
ston to speak, but about what? Even now it was quite con¬ 
ceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably 
why he had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stop¬ 
ping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. The sec¬ 
onds marched past, enormous. With difficulty Winston con¬ 
tinued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then suddenly the 
grim face broke down into what might have been the begin¬ 
nings of a smile. With his characteristic gesture O’Brien re¬ 
settled his spectacles on his nose. 

“Shall I say it, or will you?” he said. 

“I will say it,” said Winston promptly.“That thing is really 
turned off?” 

“Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.” 

« “We have come here because—” 

He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of his 
own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind of help 
he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why he had 
come here. He went on, conscious that what he was saying 
must sound both feeble and pretentious: 

, “We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some 
kind of secret organization working against the Party, and 
that you are involved in it. We want to join it and work for 
it. We are enemies of the Party. We disbelieve in the prin¬ 
ciples of Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are also 
adulterers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at 
your mercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any 
other way, we are ready.” 

He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling 
that the door had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow¬ 
faced servant had come in without knocking. Winston saw 
that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses. 

“Martin is one of us,” said O’Brien impassively. “Bring the 
-rdrinks over here, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have 
we enough chairs? Then we may as well sit down and talk in 

129 



comfort. Bring a chair for yourself, Martin. This is business. 
You can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes.” » 

The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with 
a servantlike air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Win¬ 
ston regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him 
that the man’s whole life was playing a part, and that he felt 
it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for 
a moment. O’Brien took the decanter by the neck and filled 
up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused in Winston 
dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a 
hoarding—a vast bottle composed of electric lights which 
seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a 
glass. Seen from the top the stuff looked almost black, but in 
the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. It had a sour-sweet smell. 
He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank 
curiosity. 

“It is called wine,” said O’Brien with a faint smile. “You 
will have read about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it 
gets to the Outer Party, I am afraid.” His face grew solemn 
again, and he raised his glass: “I think it is fitting that we 
should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To Em¬ 
manuel Goldstein.” 

Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine 
was a thing he had read and dreamed about. Like the glass 
paperweight or Mr. Charrington’s half-remembered rhymesr 
it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the olden time as 
he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason he 
had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet 
taste, like that of blackberry jam, and an immediate intoxicat¬ 
ing effect. Actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuff was 
distinctly disappointing. The truth was that after years of gin 
drinking he could barely taste it. He set down the empty glass. 

“Then there is such a person as Goldstein?” he said. 

“Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where I do not 
know.” 

“And the conspiracy—the organization? It is real? It is not 
simply an invention of the Thought Police?” 

“No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never 
learn much more about the Brotherhood than that it exists 
and that you belong to it. I will come back to that presently. 

He looked at his wristwatch. “It is unwise even for members 
of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for more than 
half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and 
you will have to leave separately. You, comrade—” he bowed 
his head to Julia—“will leave first. We have about twenty 
minutes at our disposal. You will understand that I must 

130 


start by asking you certain questions. In genera! terms, what 
are you prepared to do?” 

* “Anything that we are capable of,” said Winston. 

O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he 
was facing Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take 
it for granted that Winston could speak for her. For a moment 
the lids flitted down over his eyes. He began asking his ques¬ 
tions in a low, expressionless voice, as though this were a 
routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers were 
known to him already. 

"You are prepared to give your lives 0 ” 

“Yes.” 

“You are prepared to commit murder?” 

“Yes.”

He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with 


somewhat more expression in it: 

“Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be * 
as a different person? We may be obliged to give him a new 
identity. His face, his movements, the shape of his hands, the 
color of his hair—even his voice would be different. And 
you yourself might have become a different person. Our 
surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes It 
is necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.” 

Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance 
at Martin’s Mongolian face. There were no scars that he 
could see. Julia had turned a shade paler, so that her freckles 
were showing, but she faced O’Brien boldly. She murmured 
something that seemed to be assent. 

“Good. Then that is settled.” 

There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a 
rather absent-minded air O'Brien pushed them toward the 
others, took one himself, then stood up and began to pace 
slowly to and fro, as though he could think better standing 
They were very good cigarettes, very thick and well-packed 
with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O’Brien looked at 
his wristwatch again. 

“You had better go back to you^ pantry, Martin,” he said 
“I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look 
at these comrades’ faces before you go. You will be seeing.^, 
them again. I may not.” 

Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man - 
dark eyes flickered over their faces. There was not a trace of 
friendliness in his manner. He was memorizing their appear 
ance, but he felt no interest in them, or appeared to fee! 
none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was per¬ 
haps incapable of changing its expression. Without speaking 
or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the 
door silently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, 
one hand in the pocket of his black overalls, the other holding 


his cigarette. _ . . . 

“You understand,” he said, “that you will be fighting in the 

dark. You will always be in the dark. You will receive orders 
and you will obey them, without knowing why. Later I shall 
send you a book from which you will learn the _ true nature 
of the society we live in, and the strategy by which we sha 
destroy it. When you have read the book, you will be full 
members of the Brotherhood. But between the general aims 
that we are fighting for, and the immediate tasks of the mo¬ 
ment, you will never know anything. I tell you that th ®- 
Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it numbers 


132 


a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal 
knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even 
as many as a dozen. You will have three or four contacts, 
who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear. As 
this was your first contact, it will be preserved. When you 
receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary 
to communicate with you, it will be through Martin. When 
you are finally caught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. 
Butjrou will have very little to confess, other than your own 
actions. You will not be able to betray more than a handful 
of unimportant people. Probably you will not even betray 
me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a 
different person, with a different face.” 

He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In 
spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable 
grace in his movements. It came out even in the gesture with 
which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated a 
cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an impression 
of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. How¬ 
ever much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the sin¬ 
gle-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of 
murder, suicide, venereal disease, amputated limbs, and altered 
faces,^ it was with a faint air of persiflage. ‘This is unavoid¬ 
able, his voice seemed to say; “this is what we have got to 

♦ u u ?V ,n . ch « n gly. But this is not what we shall be doing 
when life is worth living again.” A wave of admiration, almost 
ot worship, flowed out from Winston toward O’Brien. For the 
moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of Goldstein. 
When you looked at O’Brien’s powerful shoulders and his 

u° “ gly and yet 50 civilized, it was im-

mation that would lead them to a complete list. No such list 
exists. The Brotherhod cannot be wiped out because it is 
not an organization in the ordinary sense. Nothing holds it C 
together except an idea which is indestructible. You will never 
have anything to sustain you except the idea. You will get no 
comradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are 
caught, you will get no help. We never help our members. 
At most, when it 7s absolutely necessary that someone should 
be silenced, we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade 
into a prisoner’s cell. You will have to get used to living 
without results and without hope. You will work for a while, 
you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. 
Those are the only results that you will ever see. There is no 
possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our 
own lifetime. We are the dead. Our only true life is in the 
future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and 
splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there 
is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present noth- 
ing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by 
little. We cannot act collectively. We can only spread our 
knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation 
after generation. In the face of the Thought Police, there is 


no other way.” . .. . . . v 

He halted and looked for the third time at his wristwatch. 

‘‘It is almost time for you to leave, comrade, he said to^ 

Julia. “Wait. The decanter is still half full.” 

He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem. 
“What shall it be this time?” he said, still with the same 
faint suggestion of irony, “To the confusion of the Thought 
Police? To the death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the 


future?” 

“To the past,” said Winston. . . 

“The past is more important,” agreed O Bnen Savely. They 
emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up. to

place frequently. Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of the 
a book —” even O’Brien, Winston noticed, seemed to pronounce 
the words as though they were in italics—“Goldstein's book, 
you understand, as soon as possible. It may be some days 
before I can get hold of one. There are not many in existence, 
as you can imagine. The Thought Police hunts them down 
and destroys them almost as fast as we can produce them. It 
makes very little difference. The book is indestructible. If the 
last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word for 
word. Do you carry a brief case to work with you?’’ he added. 

“As a rule, yes.” 

“What is it like?” 

“Black, very shabby. With two straps.” 

“Black, two straps, very shabby—good. One day in the 
fairly near future—I cannot give a date—one of the messages 
among your morning’s work will contain a misprinted word, 
and you will have to ask for a repeat. On the following day 
you will go to work without your brief case. At some time 
during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the 
arm and say, ‘I think you have dropped your brief case.’ The 
one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein’s book. You 
will return it within fourteen days.” 

They were silent for a moment. 

“There are a couple of minutes before you need go," said 
• O’Brien. “We shall meet again—if we do meet again—” 

Winston looked up at him. “In the place where there is no 
darkness?” he said hesitantly. 

O’Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. “In the 
place where there is no darkness.” he said, as though he had 
recognized the allusion. “And in the meantime, is there any¬ 
thing that you wish to say before you leave? Any message? 
Any question?” 

Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further 
question that he wanted to ask; still less did he feel any im¬ 
pulse to utter high-sounding generalities. Instead of anything 
directly connected with O’Brien or the Brotherhood, there 
came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark 
bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the 
little room over Mr. Charrington’s shop, and the glass paper¬ 
weight, and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame. Almost 
at random he said: 

Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins 
Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St. Clement's?” 

r - Again O Brien nodded. With a sort of grave courtesy he 
completed the stanza: 


135 


"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St. Clement’s, 

You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St. Martin’s, . 

When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey, 

When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch.” 

“You knew the last line!” said Winston. 

“Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time 
for you to go. But wait. You had better let me give you one 
of these tablets.” 

As Winston stood up O'Brien held out a hand. His power¬ 
ful grip crushed the bones of Winston’s palm. At the door 
Winston looked back, but O'Brien seemed already to be in 
process of putting him out of mind. He was waiting with his 
hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond him 
Winston could see the writing table with its green-shaded 
lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with 
papers. The incident was closed. Within thirty seconds, it oc¬ 
curred to him, O'Brien would be back at his interrupted and 
important work on behalf of the Party. 

IX 


Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was the 
right word. It had come into his head spontaneously. His body 
seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly, but its trans-r 
lucency. He felt that if he held up his hand he would be able 
to see the light through it. All the blood and lymph had been 
drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving 
only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations 
seemed to be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the 
pavement tickled his feet, even the opening and closing of a 
hand was an effort that made his joints creak. 

He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So 
had everyone else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, and 
he had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any descrip¬ 
tion, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six hours in 
the hiding place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in 
mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the 
direction of Mr. Charrington’s shop, keeping one eye open 
for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon 
there was no danger of anyone interfering with him. ine 
heavy brief case that he was carrying bumped against his 
knees at each step, sending a tinging sensation up and down 
the skin of his leg. Inside it was the book which he had now 
had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened, nor , 

even looked at. 


136 


On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the 
speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, 
the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing 
of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding of the 
caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming 
of guns—after six days of this, when the great orgasm was 
quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had 
boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got 
their hands on the two thousand Eurasian war criminals who 
were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, 
they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces—at just 
this moment it had been announced that Oceania was not 
after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with East- 
asia. Eurasia was an ally. 

There was, of course, no admission that any change had 
taken place. Merely it became known, with extreme sudden¬ 
ness and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia 
was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration 
in one of the central London squares at the moment when it 
happened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet 
banners were luridly floodlit. The square was packed with 
several thousand people, including a block of about a thousand 
schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet- 
draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small lean 
man with disproportionately long arms and a large, bald skull 
*over which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the 
crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, 
he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while 
the other, enormous at the end of a bony arm, clawed the air 
menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by the 
amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, 
massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prison¬ 
ers, bombing of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggres¬ 
sions, broken treaties. It was almost impossible to listen to 
him without being first convinced and then maddened. At 
every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the 
voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beastlike roaring 
that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most 
savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren. The speech 
had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a 
messenger hurried onto the platform and a scrap of paper was 
slipped into the speaker’s hand. He unrolled and read it 
without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or 
manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly 
^the names were different. Without words said, a wave of 
understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceania was at war 

137 



with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous 
commotion. The banners and posters with which the square 
was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them had the^ 
wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents of Gold¬ 
stein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude while 
posters were ripped from the walls, banners tom to shreds 
and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of 
activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the 
streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. But within two or 
three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping the 
neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his 
free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his 
speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were 
again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued exactly 
as before, except that the target had been changed. 

The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was 
that the speaker had switched from one line to the other 
actually in mid-sentence, not only without a pause, but with¬ 
out even breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had other 
things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of dis¬ 
order while the posters were being torn down that a man 
whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder 
and said, “Excuse me, I think you've dropped your brief 
case.” He took the brief case abstractedly, without speaking. 
He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity 
to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was over 
he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time 
was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staff of the 
Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issuing from 
the telescreens, recalling them to their posts, were hardly 


^Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always 
been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the pohtical litera¬ 
ture of five years was now completely obsolete. Reports; an 

records of all kinds, newspapers, books, 
sound tracks, photographs-all had to be rectified at lightn ng 
speed. Although no directive was ever issued it was known 
that the chiefs of the Department intended that with n one 
week no reference to the war with Eurasia, or thesalliance 
with Eastasia, should remain in existence anyw he rc.JITie w ®rK 
was overwhelming, all the more so because the processes th 
it involved could not be called by their true names. Everyone 
in the Records Department worked eighteen hourss inth 
twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of s ,e ep. Mattre S _ 
were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the 
corridors; meals consisted of sandwiches and Victory Cottef 

1 


wheeled round on trollcvs bl attendants from the canteen. 

* * 

Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep 
he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that 
4 he crawled back, sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that 
another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like 
a snowdrift, half burying the speakwrite and overflowing onto 
the floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into 
a neat-enough pile to give him room to work. What was worst 
of all vvas that the work was by no means purely mechanical. 
Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for an¬ 
other, but any detailed report of events demanded care and 
imagination. Even the geographical knowledge that one need¬ 
ed in transferring the war from one part of the world to 
another was considerable. 

By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spec¬ 
tacles needed wiping every few minutes. It was like struggling 
with some crushing physical task, something which one had 
the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neuroti¬ 
cally anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to re¬ 
member it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word 
he murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke of his ink 
pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was as anxious as anyone else 
in the Department that the forgery should be perfect. On 
the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed 
down. For as much as half an hour nothing came out of the 
*tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing. Everywhere at 
about the same time the work was easing oft. A deep and as 
it were secret sigh went through the Department. A mighty 
deed, which could never be mentioned, had been achieved. 
It was now impossible for any human being to prove by 
documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever 
happened. At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced 
that all workers in the Ministry were free till tomorrow morn- 
Winston, still carrying the brief case containing the hook 
which had remained between his feet while he worked and 
under his body while he slept, went home, shaved himself, 

and almost fell asleep in his bath, although the water was 
barely more than tepid.

THE THEORY AND PRACTICE 
OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM 

by 

Emmanuel Goldstein 
[Winston began reading.] 


Chapter 1. 

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. 


Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of 
the Neolithic Ace, there have been three kinds of people in 
the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have 
been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless 
different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their 
attitude toward one another, have varied from age to age; 
but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even 
after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, 
the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyro¬ 
scope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is 

pushed one way or the other. ... 

The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcil¬ 
able. . . . 


Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the 
fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety. He was alone, 
no telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous impulse to 
glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand, 
the sweet summer air played against his check. From som - 
where far away there floated the faint shouts of children, 1 
the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice 
of the clock. He settled deeper into the armchair and put hi 
feet up on the fender. It was bliss, it was eternity -Suddenly 
as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows tha 

one will ultimately read and reread every NV ? rd ;. h . e 

at a different place and found himself at the third chapt . 

He went on reading: 


Chapter 3. 

WAR IS PEACE. 

The splitting-up of the world into three great suP e |; s,a, fi 
wal an even! which could be and indeed was foreseen beforf 

140 


the middle of the twentieth century. With the absorption of 
^Europe by Russia and the British Empire by the United 
States, two of the three existing powers. Eurasia and Oceania, 
were already effectively in being. The third. Eastasia, only 
emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused 
fighting. The frontiers between the three superstates arc in 
some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according 
to the fortunes of war. but in general they follow geographi¬ 
cal lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of 
the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the 
Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic 
islands including the British Isles, Australasia, and the south¬ 
ern portion of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than the others and 
with a less definite western frontier, comprises China and the 
countries to the south of it. the Japanese islands and a large 
but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet. 

In one combination or another, these three superstates are 
permanently at war, and have been so far the past twenty-five 
years. War, however, is no longer the desperate, annihilating 
struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth 
century. It is a warfare of limited aims between combatants 
who are unable to destroy one another, have no material 
cause for fighting, and are not divided by any genuine ide¬ 
ological difference. This is not to say that either the conduct 
*&gt;f war, or the prevailing attitude toward it, has become less 
bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary, war hys¬ 
teria is continuous and universal in all countries, and such 
acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction 
of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners 
which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked 
upon as normal, and, when they are committed by one’s own 
side and not by the enemy, meritorious. But in a physical sense 
war involves very small numbers of people, mostly highly 
trained specialists, and causes comparatively few casualties 
The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague 
frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess 
at, or round the Floating Fortresses 'which guard strategic 
spots on the sea lanes. In the centers of civilization war 
means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption 
goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may 
cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its 
aracter. More exactly, the reasons for which war is waged 
have changed in their order of importance. Motives which 
were already present to some small extent in the great wars of 

frl ? . twe . ntieth cen tury have now become dominant and 
are consciously recognized and acted upon. 

141 



To understand the nature of the present war—for in spite 
of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always f 
the same war—one must realize in the first place that it is 
impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three superstates 
could be definitely conquered even by the other two in com¬ 
bination. They arc too evenly matched, and their natural de¬ 
fenses are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land 
spaces, Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, 
Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabit¬ 
ants. Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, any¬ 
thing to fight about. With the establishment of self-contained 
economies, in which production and consumption are geared 
to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main 
cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the com¬ 
petition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and 
death. In any case, each of the three superstates is so vast 
that it can obtain almost all of the materials that it needs 
within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct 
economic purpose, it is a war for labor power. Between the 
frontiers of the superstates, and not permanently in the pos¬ 
session of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral with 
its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, 
containing within it about a fifth of the population of the 
earth. It is for the possession of these thickly populated 
regions, and of the northern ice cap, that the three power* 
are constantly struggling. In practice no one power ever con¬ 
trols the whole of the disputed area. Portions of it are con¬ 
stantly changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing this or 
that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates 
the endless changes of alignment. 

All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, 
and some of them yield important vegetable products such 
as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthe¬ 
size by comparatively expensive methods. But above all they 
contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labor. Whichever power 
controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle 
East, or Southern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, dis¬ 
poses also of the bodies of scores of hundreds of millions of 
ill-paid and hard-working coolies. The inhabitants of these 
areas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass 
continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended 
like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more arma¬ 
ments, to capture more territory, to control more labor power, 
to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, and 
so on indefinitely. It should be noted that the fighting never 
really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas. The 

142 


frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin 
of the Congo and the northern shore of the Mediterranean; 
* the islands of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific are constantly 
being captured and recaptured by Oceania or by Eastasia; in 
Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and Eastasia is 
never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim to 
enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and 
unexplored; but the balance of power always remains roughly 
even, and the territory which forms the heartland of each 
superstate always remains inviolate. Moreover, the labor of 
the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really neces¬ 
sary to the world's economy. They add nothing to the wealth 
of the world, since whatever they produce is used for pur¬ 
poses of war, and the object of waging a war is always to be 
in a better position in which to wage another war. By their 
labor the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous 
warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the struc¬ 
ture of world society, and the process by which it maintains 
itself, would not be essentially different. 

The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with 
the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously 
recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the 
Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without 
raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of 
the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the 
‘•surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial 
society. At present, when few human beings even have enough 
to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not 
have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction 
had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry, 
dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 
1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future 
to which the people of that period looked forward. In the 
early twentieth century, the vision of a future society unbe¬ 
lievably rich, leisured, orderly and efficient—a glittering anti¬ 
septic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete—was 
part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Sci¬ 
ence and technology were developing at a prodigious speed, 
and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on devel¬ 
oping. This failed to happen, partly because of the impover¬ 
ishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, 
partly because scientific and technical progress depended on 
the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a 
strictly regimented society. As a whole the world is more 
primitive today than it was fifty years ago. Certain backward 
weas have advanced, and various devices, always in some 

143 


way connected with warfare and police espionage, have been 
developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped, 
and the ravages of the atomic war of the Nineteen-fifties have* 
never been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent 
in the machine are still there. From the moment when the 
machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking 
people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to 
a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the 
machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, over¬ 
work, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within 
a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any 
such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process—by produc¬ 
ing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute 
—the machine did raise the living standards of the average 
human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years 
at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth 
centuries. 

But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth 
threatened the destruction—indeed, in some sense was the 
destruction—of a hierarchical society. In a world in which 
everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a 
house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a 
motorcar or even an airplane, the most obvious and perhaps 
the most important form of inequality would already have 
disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confc^ 
no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society 
in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and 
luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained 
in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such 
a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and secur¬ 
ity were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human 
beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become 
literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when 
once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize 
that the privileged minority had no function, and they would 
sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only 
possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to 
the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning 
of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practi¬ 
cable solution. It conflicted with the tendency toward mech¬ 
anization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout 
almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which 
remained industrially backward was helpless in a military 
sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, 
by its more advanced rivals. 

Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in 

144 


poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to 
a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly 
^between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries 
was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital 
equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population 
were prevented from working and kept half alive by State 
charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since 
the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made 
opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the 
wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth 
of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be 
distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was 
by continuous warfare. 

The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of 
human lives, but of the products of human labor. War is a 
way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, 
or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might 
otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and 
hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons 
of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still 
a convenient way of expending labor power without pro¬ 
ducing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, 
for example, has locked up in it the labor that would build 
several hundred cargo ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as 
obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to any¬ 
body, and with further enormous labors another Floating 
Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so 
planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meet¬ 
ing the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of 
the population are always underestimated, with the result that 
there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but 
this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to 
keep even the favored groups somewhere near the brink of 
hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the 
importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinc¬ 
tion between one group and another. By the standards of the 
early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party 
lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few 
luxuries that he does enjoy—his large well-appointed flat, the 
better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and 
drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private 
motorcar or helicopter—set him in a different world from a 
member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer 
Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the sub¬ 
merged masses whom we call “the proles.” The social atmos¬ 
phere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump 

145 


of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. 
And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and# 
therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to 
a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of sur¬ 
vival. 

War, it will be seen, not only accomplishes the necessary 
destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically accept¬ 
able way. In principle it would be quite simple to waste the 
surplus labor of the world by building temples and pyramids, 
by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by pro¬ 
ducing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. 
But this would provide only the economic and not the emo¬ 
tional basis for a hierarchical society. What is concerned 
here is not the morale of the masses, whose attitude is unim¬ 
portant so long as they arc kept steadily at work, but the 
morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member 
is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent 
within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should 
be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods 
are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In other 
words it is necessary that he should have the mentality ap¬ 
propriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the 
war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is 
possible, it docs not matter whether the war is going well or 
badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should exist*- 
The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires of 
its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmos- 

w 

pherc of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the 
ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely 
in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy 
are strongest. In his capacity as an administrator, it is often 
necessary for a member of the Inner Party to know that this 
or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often be 
aware that the entire war is spurious and is cither not happen¬ 
ing or is being waged for purposes quite other than the 
declared ones; but such knowledge is easily neutralized by 
the technique of doublethink. Meanwhile no Inner Party 
member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the 
war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with 
Oceania the undisputed master of the entire world. 

All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming 
conquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved either by 
gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building 
up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the dis¬ 
covery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search* 
for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the 

146 


very few remaining activities in which the inventive or specu¬ 
lative type of mind can find any outlet. In Oceania at the 
^present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to 
exist. In Newspeak there is no word for “Science." The em¬ 
pirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achieve¬ 
ments of the past were founded, is opposed to the most 
fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even technological 
progress only happens when its products can in some way be 
used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful 
arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. T he 
fields are cultivated with horse plows while books are written 
by machinery. But in matters of vital importance—meaning, 
in effect, war and police espionage—the empirical approach 
is still encouraged, or at least tolerated. The two aims of the 
Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to 
extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent 
thought. There are therefore two great problems which the 
Party is concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against 
his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other 
is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds 
without giving warning beforehand. In so far as scientific re¬ 
search still continues, this is its subject matter. The scientist of 
today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor, study¬ 
ing with extraordinary minuteness the meaning of facial ex¬ 
pressions, gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth- 
producing effects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and phys¬ 
ical torture; or he is a chemist, physicist, or biologist con¬ 
cerned only with such branches of his special subject as are 
relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories of the 
Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden 
in the Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on 
lost islands of the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indc- 
fatigably at work. Some are concerned simply with planning 
the logistics of future wars; others devise larger and larger 
rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more 
and more impenetrable armor-plating; others search for new 
and deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being 
produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of 
whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized 
against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce a 
vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine 
under the water, or an airplane as independent of its base as 
a sailing ship; others explore even remoter possibilities such 
as focusing the sun’s rays through lenses suspended thousands 
of kilometers away in space, or producing artificial earth- 

147 


quakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth's 
center. 

But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near real¬ 
ization, and none of the three superstates ever gains a signi¬ 
ficant lead on the others. What is more remarkable is that all 


three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, a weapon 
far more powerful than any that their present researches are 
likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its habit, 
claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as 
early as the Nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large 
scale about ten years later. At that time some hundreds of 
bombs were dropped on industrial centers, chiefly in Eu¬ 
ropean Russia, Western Europe, and North America. The 
effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that 
a few' more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized 
society, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although 
no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more 
bombs were dropped. All three powers merely continue to 
produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive 
opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later. 
And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary 
for thirty or forty years. Helicopters are more used than they 
were formerly, bombing planes have been largely superseded 
by self-propelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battle¬ 
ship has given way to the almost unsinkablc Floating Fort¬ 
ress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank*, 
the submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle 
and the hand grenade are still in use. And in spite of the 
endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreens 
the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds ot 
thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few 


weeks, have never been repeated. 

None of the three superstates ever attempts any maneuver 
which involves the risk of serious defeat. When any large 
operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack against 
an ally. The strategy that all three powers arc foUow.ng. or 
pretend to themselves that they are following, is the same. 
The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, 
well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases 
completely encircling one or other of the rival states, and 
^hcTt o sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain 
on peaceM terms for so many years as to lull susp.cmn to 

ssss ws a. 

148 


friendship with the remaining world power, in preparation 
for another attack. This scheme, it is hardly necessary to say, 
is a mere daydream, impossible of realization. Moreover, no 
fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the 
Equator and the Pole; no invasion of enemy territory is ever 
undertaken. This explains the fact that in some places the 
frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary. Eurasia, for 
example, could easily conquer the British Isles, which are 
geographically part of Europe, or on the other hand it would 
be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine or 
even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, fol¬ 
lowed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural 
integrity. If Oceania were to conquer the areas that used 
once to be known as France and Germany, it would be 
necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of 
great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about 
a hundred million people, who, so far as technical develop¬ 
ment goes, are roughly on the Oceanic level. The problem 
is the same for all three superstates. It is absolutely necessary 
to their structure that there should be no contact with for¬ 
eigners except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners and 
colored slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always 
regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the 
average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of 
^either Eurasia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge 
of foreign languages. If he were allowed contact with for¬ 
eigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to 
himself and that most of what he has been told about them 
is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, 
and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his 
morale depends might evaporate. It is therefore realized on all 
sides that however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon 
may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed 
by anything except bombs. 

Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly 
understood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of 
life in all three superstates are very much the same. In Oceania 
the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc. in Eurasia it is 
called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called by a 
Chinese name usually translated as Death-worship, but per¬ 
haps better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen 
of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of 
the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them 
as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense, 
^dually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable, and 
the social systems which they support are not distinguishable 

149 


at all. Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the 
same worship of a semi-divine leader, the same economy ^ 
existing by .and for continuous warfare. It follows that the 
three superstates not only cannot conquer one another, but 
would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary, so 
lone as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, li. e 
three sheaves of corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all 
three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what 
they are doing. Their lives are dedicated to world conquest 
but' they also know that it is necessary that the war should 
continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the 
fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the 
denial of realitv which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its 
rival systems of thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what 
has been said earlier, that by becoming continuous war has 

fundamentally changed its character. 

In past ages, a war. almost by definition, was somethin-, 
that sooner or later came to an end. usually in unmistakable 
victory or defeat. In the past. also, war was one of he mam 
instruments by which human societies were kept in touen 
with physical realitv. All rulers of all ages have tried to i * 
pose a false view of the world upon their .followers but they 
could not afford to encourage any illusion ^at tend 
impair military efficiency. So long as defeat meant theMoss 
of independence, or some other result generally h eld ° bc - 
undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be seno, ■ 

Ph sical facts could not be ignored. In P* ,,,OS 2?2’'°\but 'when

But when war becomes literally connnu such

the most palpable facts can c^d ^ ca]Jed scicntific are _st.lL 

have seen, researches t « essentially 

carried out for the purposes of^var, but tncy 






a kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is 
♦ not important. Efficiency, even military efficiency, i&gt; no 
longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the 
Thought Police. Since each of the three superstates is un¬ 
conquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within which 
almost any perversion of thought can be safely practiced 
Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday 
life—the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, 
to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top-story win¬ 
dow's, and the like. Between life and death, and between 
physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a distinction, 
but that is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world, and 
with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in inter¬ 
stellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is 
up and which is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute, 
as the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be. They are obliged 
to prevent their followers from starving to death in number- 
large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged to re¬ 
main at the same low level of military technique as their 
rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist 
reality into whatever shape they choose. 

The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards ol 
previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles 
between certain ruminant animals whose horns arc set at 
&lt;*uch an angle that they arc incapable of hurting one another. 
But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It cats up the 
surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the 
special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. 
War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the 
past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might 
recognize their common interest and therefore limit the de¬ 
structiveness of war. did fight against one another, and the 
victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day 
they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is 
waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the 
object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of ter- 
iitory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very 
word “war,” therefore, has become misleading. It would 
probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous 
war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted 
on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early 
twentieth century has disappeared and has been replaced by 
something quite different. The effect would be much the same 
if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should 
^gree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own 
boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-con- 

151 


tained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of 
external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be 
the same as a permanent war. This—although the vast major¬ 
ity of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense 
—is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: war is peace. 

Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in 
remote distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feel¬ 
ing of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room with 
no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude and safety were 
physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness 
of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint 
breeze from the window that played upon his cheek. The book 
fascinated him. or more exactly it reassured him. In a sense 
it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the 
attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been 
possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It 
was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously 
more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best 
books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know 
already. He had just turned back to Chapter 1 when he heard 
Julia’s footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to 
meet her. She dumped her brown tool bag on the floor and 
flung herself into his arms. It was more than a week since

Chapter I. 

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. 

Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of 
the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in 
the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have 
been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless 
different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their 
attitude toward one another, have varied from age to age; 
but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even 
after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, 
the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyro¬ 
scope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is 
pushed one way or the other. 

“Julia, are you awake?” said Winston. 

“Yes, my love. I'm listening. Go on. It's marvelous.” 

He continued reading: 

The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable 
The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim 
of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of 
the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding char¬ 
acteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by 
drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of any¬ 
thing outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions 
and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus 
throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main 
outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods the 
High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there 
always comes a moment when they lose either their belief 
in t lemsclves, or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. 
Hiey arc then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low 
on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for 
liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their ob¬ 
jective the Middle thrust the Low back into their old posi- 
tion of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently 
a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups 
or from both of them, and the struggle begins over^ again.’ 
OL the three groups, only the Low are never even tem- 

153 


porarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an 
exaggeration to say that throughout history' there had been ^ 
no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of 
decline, the average human being is physically better off 
than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, 
no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever 
brought human equality a millimeter nearer. From the point 
of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much 
more than a change in the name of their masters. 

By the late nineteenth century the recurrences of this pat¬ 
tern had become obvious to many observers. There then 
arose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical 
process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalter¬ 
able law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had always 
had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put 
forward there was a significant change. In the past the need 
for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine 
specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings and 
aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were 
parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened by 
promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the 
orave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power 
had always made use of such terms as freedom, justice: and 
fraternity. Now, however, the concept of human brotherhood 
began to be assailed by people who were not yet ir‘ P 0 ?'* 1 ®™ * 
of “command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the 
past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of 
euualitv and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon 
S the old one was overthrown. The new Middle groups m 
effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand. Socahsm. a

ATusuah the High were tS S’ turned ou, by the Middle. who 

154 




would then become the High: but this time, by conscious 
« strategy, the High would be able to maintain their position 
permanently. 

The new doctrines arose partly because ol the accumula¬ 
tion of historical knowledge, and the growth of the histori¬ 
cal sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth 
century. The cyclical movement of history was now intel¬ 
ligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then 
it was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, 
as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, human 
equality had become technically possible. It was still true 
that men were not equal in their native talents and that 
functions had to be specialized in ways that favored some 
individuals against others; but there was no longer any real 
need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. 
In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable 
but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization. With 
the development of machine production, however, the case 
was altered. Even if it was still necessary for human beings 
to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for 
them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, 
from the point of view of the new groups who were on the 
point of seizing power, human equality was no longer an ideal 
to be striven after, but a danger to be averted. In more 
♦primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was in fact 
not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe in it. The idea 
of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in 
a state of brotherhood, w'ithout laws and without brute labor, 
nad haunted the human imagination for thousands of years. 
And this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups 
who actually profited by each historic change. The heirs of 
the French, English, and American revolutions had partlv 
believed in their own phrases about the rights of man. free¬ 
dom of speech, equality before the law', and the like, and 
had even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to 
some extent. But by the fourth decade of the twentieth cen¬ 
tury all the main currents of political thought were authori¬ 
tarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly 
the moment when it became realizable. Every new political 
theory, by what ever name it called itself, led back to hier¬ 
archy and regimentation. And in the general hardening of 
outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which'had 
been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years— 
imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as 
rflaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the 

se of hostages and the deportation of whole populations— 

155 


not only became common again, but were tolerated and even 
defended by people who considered themselves enlightened-j 
and progressive. 

It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, 
revolutions and counterrevolutions in all parts of the world 
that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked-out political 
theories. But they had been foreshadowed by the various 
systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared 
earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world 
which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long 
been obvious. What kind of people would control this world 
had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy was made 
up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, 
trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists, teach¬ 
ers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, 
whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper 
grades of the working class, had been shaped and brought 
together by the barren world of monopoly industry and cen¬ 
tralized government. As compared with their opposite num¬ 
bers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by 
luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more con¬ 
scious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing 
opposition. This last difference was cardinal. By comparison 
with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were 
half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling groups were always, 
infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to 
leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act, 
and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. 
Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant 
by modern standards. Part of the reason for this was that in 
the past no government had the power to keep its citizens 
under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however, 
made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the himi ana 
the radio carried the process further. With the devdopmen 
of television, and the technical advance which made it pos¬ 
sible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same^in¬ 
strument, private life came to an end. Every citizen, or at 
least every citizen important enough to be worth watching, 
could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under he eyes 
the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with al 
other channels of communication closed. The Possibility of 
enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the 
State, but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, 

existed for the first time. . j civtie^ •&gt; 

After the revolutionary period of the Fi. * es and 

society regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, 

156 



Low. But the new High group, unlike all its forerunners, did 
4 not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard 
its position. It had long been realized that the only secure 
basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege are 
most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The 
so-called “abolition of private property” which took place in 
the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the con¬ 
centration of property in far fewer hands than before; but 
with this difference, that the new owners were a group in¬ 
stead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of 
the Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. 
Collectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, because 
it controls everything and disposes of the products as it thinks 
fit. In the years following the Revolution it was able to step 
into this commanding position almost unopposed, because 
the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization. 
It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were 
expropriated. Socialism must follow; and unquestionably the 
capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, 
houses, transport—everything had been taken away from 
them; and since these things were no longer private property, 
it followed that they must be public property. Ingsoc, which 
grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited its 

I * in fact carried out the main item in the 

^Socialist program, with the result, foreseen and intended be¬ 
forehand, that economic inequality has been made perma¬ 
nent. 


But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society 
go deeper than this. There are only four ways in which a rul¬ 
ing group can fall from power. Either it is conquered from 
without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are 
stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle 

2 Up ,!° come ,nto be ing. or it loses its own self-confidence 
nd willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singlv,

rui ng class which could guard against all of them would re- 

S is L U,,imatc, y thc determining fac- 

Af/.ITental attitude of the ruling class itself. 

After the middle of the present centurv, thc first danocr 
had in reahty disappeared. Each of the three powers which 
now divide the world is in fact unconquerable and coild 
whirh s. mC conquerable through slow demographic changes 
second d 8 r„ e /" m r‘ Wi,h Y ide P° wers &lt;»" easily aver. The 

157 


permitted to have standards of comparison they never even 
become aware that they are oppressed. The recurrent economic * 
crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now 
permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations 
can and do happen without having political results, because 
there is no way in which discontent can become articulate. 
As for the problem of overproduction, which has been latent 
in our society since the development of machine technique, 
it is solved by the device of continuous warfare (see Chap¬ 
ter 3), which is also useful in keying up public morale to 
the necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present 
rulers, therefore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting- 
off of a new group of able, underemployed, power-hungry 
people, and the growth of liberalism and skepticism in their 
own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational. It is 
a problem of continuously molding the consciousness both of 
the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies 

immediately below it. The consciousness of the masses needs 

* 

only to be influenced in a negative way. 

Given this background, one could infer, if one did not 
know it already, the general structure of Oceanic society. At 
the apex of the pyramid comes Big Brother. Big Brother is 
infallible and all-powerful. Every success, every achievement, 
every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all 
wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, arc held tc issue directly*- 
from his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen 
Big Brother. He is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the 
telescreen. We may be reasonably sure that he will never die, 
and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he 
was born. Big Brother is the guise in which the Party chooses 
to exhibit itself to the world. His function is to act as a 
focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which 
are more easily felt toward an individual than toward an 
organization. Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party, its 
numbers limited to six millions, or something less than two 
per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner Party 
comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described 
as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands. 
Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer 
to as “the proles," numbering perhaps eighty-five per cent of 
the population. In the terms of our earlier classification, the 
proles arc the Low, for the slave populations of the equatorial 
lands, who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror, are 
not a permanent or necessary part of the structure. 

In principle, membership in these three groups is nor* 
hereditary. The child of Inner Party parents is in theory not 

158 



bom into the Inner Party. Admission to either branch of 
the Party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor 
^is there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination 
of one province by another. Jews, Negroes. South Americans 
of pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks &gt;f 
the Party, and the administrators of any area arc always 
drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no part of Oceania 
do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a coloni. 1 
population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania has no 
capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts 
nobody knows. Except that English is its chief lingua franca 
and Ncwspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any 
way. Its rulers are not held together by blood ties but by 
adherence to a common doctrine. It is true that our society 
is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what at first sight 
appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to-and-fro 


movement between the dilferent groups than happened under 
capitalism or even in the pre-industrial ages. Between the two 
branches of the Party there is a certain amount of inter¬ 
change, but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are 
excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious members 
ot the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to 
rise. Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate 
into the Party. The most gifted among them, who might pos¬ 
sibly become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down 
by the Thought Police and eliminated. But this state of affairs 
is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of principle. 
The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does 
not aim at transmitting power to its own children, ns such; 
and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people 
.it the top, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire 
new generation from the ranks of the proletariat. In the crucial 
years, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a 
great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind of So¬ 
cialist, who had been trained to fight against something called 
class privilege,” assumed that what is not hereditary cannot 
be permanent. He did not see that the continuity of an

successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its 


159 


blood but with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not 
important, provided that the hierarchical structure remains 
always the same. 

All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes 
that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the 
mystique of the Party and prevent the true nature of present- 
day society from being perceived. Physical rebellion, or any 
preliminary move toward rebellion, is at present not possible. 
From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to them¬ 
selves, they will continue from generation to generation and 
from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not 
only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of 
grasping that the world could be other than it is. They could 
only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique 
made it necessary to educate them more highly; but, since 
military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the 
level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions 
the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of 
indifference. They can be granted intellectual liberty because 
they have no intellect. In a Party member, on the other hand, 
not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most un¬ 


important subject can be tolerated. 

A Party member lives from birth to death under tnc eye 
of the Thought Police. Even when he is alone he can never 
be sure that" he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or 
awake, working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he can be 
inspected without warning and without knowing tnat he is 
beinc inspected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. H.s 
friendships, his relaxations, his behavior toward his wife and 
children, the expression of his face when he is alon ^ ,he 
words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements 
of his body, are all jealously scrutinized. Not on y any actual 
misdemeanor, but any eccentricity, however small, any chang 
of habits, any nervous mannerism that couW possibly be 
symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected. He 
has no freedom of choice in any direct,on whatever On the 
other hand, his actions are not regulated by law or by any 
clearly formulated code of behavior. In Oceania ‘here 
law. Thoughts and actions which, when detected m 
tain death are not formally forbidden and * h ? “^ Iess p e no j 
arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and' „ bccn 

inflicted as punishment for crimes whicti have aetu y 

160 


manded of him are never plainly stated, and could not be 
♦ stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in 
Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (in Newspeak, a 
good thinker) , he will in all circumstances know, without tak¬ 
ing thought, what is the true belief or the desirable emotion. 
But in any case an elaborate mental training, undergone in 
childhood and grouping itself round the Newspeak words 
crimestop. blackwhite, and doublethink, makes him unwill¬ 
ing and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever. 

A Partv member is expected to have no private emotions 
and no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in 
a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and in¬ 
ternal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement 
before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents 
produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned 
outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes 
Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a 
skeptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his 
early acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stage 
in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children, 
is called, in Newspeak, crimestop. Crimestop means the faculty 
of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of 
any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping 
analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunder¬ 
standing the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc, 
and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which 
is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crimestop, in 
short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. 
On the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a con¬ 
trol over one's own mental processes as complete as that of a 
contortionist over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately 
on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the 
Party is infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnip¬ 
otent and the Party is not infallible, there is need for an 
unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment 
of facts. The key word here is blackwhite. Like so many New¬ 
speak words, this word has two mutually contradictory mean¬ 
ings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudent¬ 
ly claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain 
facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness 
to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. 
But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and 
more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has 
ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous altera¬ 
tion of the past, made possible by the system of thought which 

161 



really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak 
as doublethink. ' 

The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one 
of which is subsidiary and. so to speak, precautionary. The 
subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like the prole¬ 
tarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because he has 
no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from the 
past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, be¬ 
cause it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off 
than his ancestors'and that the average level of material com¬ 
fort is constantly rising. But by far the more important reason 
for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the 
infallibility of the Party. It is not merely that speeches, statis- 
tics, and records of every kind must be constantly broug it 
up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party 
were in all cases right. It is also that no change of doctrine 
or in political alignment can ever be admitted. For to change 
one s mind, or even one's policy, is a confession of weakness. 
If, for example. Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever it may be) is 
the cnemv todav. then that country muM always have been 
the enemv. And if the facts say otherwise, then the facts must 
be altered. Thus history is continuously rewritten. This day- 
to-day falsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of 
Truth, is as necessary to the stability of the regtme as the 
work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry# 

° f Th°e V mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. 
Past events, it is argued, have no objcchve existence, but sur¬ 
vive only in written records and in human memories. The 
past is whales er the records and the memories agree upon 
And since the Party is in full control of all record • and in 
equally full control of the minds of its members, . follo vs 
that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it. It a 
follows that though the past is alterable, it "ever has been 
altered in any specific instance. For when it has been rccre 
"ted in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this 
new version is the past, and no different past car. ever h 
existed. This holds good even when, as often happen , 
same event has to be altered out of recognition several tiir^ 
nThe course of a year. At all times the Party is ,n possession 

162 




the desired manner. And if it is necessary to rearrange one’s 
memories or to tamper with written records, then it is neces¬ 
sary to forget that one has done so. The trick of doing this 
can be learned like any other mental technique. It is learned 
by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who 
are intelligent as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, 
quite frankly, “reality control.” In Newspeak it is called 
doublethink, although doublethink comprises much else as 
well. 


Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory 
beliefs in one’s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of 
them. The Party intellectual knows in which direction his 
memories must be altered: he therefore knows that he is 
playing tricks with reality: but by the exercise of doublethink 
he also satisfies himselt that reality is not violated. The process 
has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with suffi¬ 
cient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would 
bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. Double¬ 
think lies at the very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of 
the Party is to use conscious deception while retaining the 
firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell 
deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget 
any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it be¬ 
comes necessary again, to draw' it back from oblivion for just 
so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective real- 
tty and all the while to take account of the reality which one 
denies all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the 
word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink'. For 
y using the word one admits that one is tampering with 
reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowl- 
e d g e; and s° on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap 
ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of doublethink 
that the Party has been able—and may, for all we know, con-

163 


.Tra 


and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the 
sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is to combine a 
belief in one’s own infallibility with the power to learn from' 
past mistakes. 

It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of 
doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know 
that it is a vast system of mental cheating. In our society, 
those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are 
also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. 
In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delu¬ 
sion: the more intelligent, the less sane. One clear illustration 
of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as 
one rises in the social scale. Those whose attitude toward the 
war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the 
disputed territories. To these people the war is simply a 
continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their 
bodies like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a matter 
of complete indifference to them. They are aware that a 
change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing 
the same work as before for new masters who treat them in 
the same manner as the old ones. The slightly more favored 
workers whom we call “the proles” are only intermittently 
conscious of the war. When it is necessary they can be 
prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to 
themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods 
that the war is happening. It is in the ranks of the Party, and 
above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm 
is found. World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those 
who know it to be impossible. This peculiar linking-together 
of opposites—knowledge with ignorance, cynicism with fana¬ 
ticism—is one of the chief distinguishing marks of Oceanic 
society. The official ideology abounds with contradictions even 
where there is no practical reason for them. Thus, the Party 
rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist 
movement originally stood, and it chooses to do this in the 
name of Socialism. It preaches a contempt for the working 
class unexampled for centuries past, and it dresses its mem¬ 
bers in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual 
workers and was adopted for that reason. It systematically 
undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader 
by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiments of 
family loyalty. Even the names of the four Ministries by 
which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their 
deliberate reversal of the facts. The Ministry of Peace con¬ 
cerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies th a 
Ministry of Love with torture, and the Ministry of Plenty 

164 




with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor 
do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate 
&lt; exercises in doublethink. For it is only by reconciling con¬ 
tradictions that power can be retained indefinitely. In no 
other way could the ancient cycle be broken. If human equal¬ 
ity is to be forever averted—if the High, as we have called 
them, are to keep their places permanently—then the pre¬ 
vailing mental condition must be controlled insanity. 

But there is one question which until this moment we have 
almost ignored. It is: why should human equality be averted? 
Supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly 
described, what is the motive for this huge, accurately planned 
effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time? 

Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen, the 
mystique of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, de¬ 
pends upon doublethink. But deeper than this lies the original 
motive, the never-questioned instinct that first led to the 
seizure of power and brought doublethink, the Thought 
Police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary para¬ 
phernalia into existence afterwards. This motive really con¬ 
sists . . . 


Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware 
of a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been very 
still tor some time past. She was lying on her side, naked 
♦from the waist upwards, with her check pillowed on her hand 
and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Her breast rose 
and fell slowly and regularly. 

“Julia.” 

No answer. 


“Julia, are you awake?” 

No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it care¬ 
fully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet over 
both of them. 

He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. 
He understood how; he did not understand why. Chapter 1, 
like Chapter 3, had not actually to'.d him anything that he 
did not know; it had merely systematized the knowledge that 
e possessed already. But alter reading it he knew better than 
before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a 
mmority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth 
and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even 

f™ S l thC - V h ° C world ’ y° u were not mad. A yellow beam 
om the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell 

r*L °!f p he PI,1 °k'u H ! $hut h ' S Cyes - The sun on his face and 
the to irl s smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, 

165 



sleepy, confident feeling. He was safe, everything was all 
right. He fell asleep murmuring “Sanity is not statistical,” 
with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound 
wisdom. 


x 

When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for 
a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him 
that it was only twenty-thirty. He lay dozing for a little while; 
then the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard 
below: 


“It was only an 'opeless fancy, 

It passed like an Ipril dye, 

But a look an’ a word an’ the dreams they stirred 
They ’ave stolen my ’eart awye!” 


The driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity. You 
still heard it all over the place. It had outlived the “Hate 
Song." Julia woke at the sound, stretched herself luxuriously, 
and got out of bed. 

“I’m hungry,” she said. “Let's make some more coffee. 
Damn! The stove’s gone out and the water's cold.” She 
picked the stove up and shook it. “There’s no oil in it. ^ 

“We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.’ 

“The funny thing is 1 made sure it was full. I’m going to 
put my clothes on,” she added. “It seems to have got colder.” 

Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefat¬ 
igable voice sang on: 


“They sye that time 'eals all things, 

They sye you can always forget; 

But the smiles an’ the tears acrorss the years 
They twist my ’eartstrings yet!" 


As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to 
the window. The sun must have gone down behind the 
houses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. The flag¬ 
stones were wet as though they had just been washed and 

he had the feeling that the sky had been ^ 

and pale was the blue between the chimney pots. Tirelessly 

the woman marched to and fro corking and ^"^e dLers’ 
self sinking and fallen silent, and pegging out more diapers 
f'V metre and vet more. He wondered whether she took in* 
washing for a j|?i„”°or was merely .he slave of twenty or 

166 



thirty’ izrandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; to¬ 
gether they cazed down with a sort of fascination at 
sturdy figure below. As he looked at the woman m her char¬ 
acteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up lor^ the line 
her powerful marelike buttocks protruded it struck him for 
the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before 
occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up 
to monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened, 
roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over¬ 
ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after all, 
he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a 
block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same 
relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why 
should the fruit be held inferior to the flower? 

“She’s beautiful,” he murmured.. 

“She’s a meter across the hips, easily.” said Julia. 

“That is her style of beauty,” said Winston. 

He held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm. 
From the hip to the knee her flank was against his. Out of 
their bodies no child would ever come. That was the one thing 
they could never do. Only by word of mouth, from mind to 
mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman down there 
had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a 
fertile belly. He wondered how many children she had given 
^irth to. It might easily be fifteen. She had had her momen¬ 
tary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wildrose beauty, and then 
she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown 
hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been launder¬ 
ing. scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mend¬ 
ing, scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grand¬ 
children. over thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she 
was still singing. The mystical reverence that he felt for her 
was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale, cloudless 
sky, stretching away behind the chimney pots into intermin¬ 
able distances. It was curious to think that the sky was the 
same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. 
And the people under the sky were also very much the same— 
everywhere, all over the w’orld, hundreds or thousands of 
millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one an¬ 
other’s existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and 
yet almost exactly the same—people who had never learned 
to think but were storing up in their hearts and bellies and 
' muscles the power that would one day overturn the world. 
If there was hope, it lay in the proles! Without having read 
&lt;*o the end of the book, ' knew that that must be Goldstein’s 
final message. The futuie belonged to the proles. And could 

167 


he he sure that when their time came, the world they con¬ 
structed would not be just as alien to him. Winston Smith, 
as the world of the Party? Yes, because at the least it would? 
be a world of sanity. Where there is equality there can be 
sanity. Sooner or later it would happen: strength would 
change into consciousness. The proles were immortal; you 
could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in 
the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until 
that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they 
would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on 
from body to body the vitality which the Party did not 
share and could not kill. 

“Do you remember,” he said, “the thrush that sang to us, 
that first day, at the edge of the wood?” 

“He wasn’t singing to us,” said Julia. “He was singing to 
please himself. Not even that. He was just singing.” 

The birds sang, the proles sang, the Party did not sing. All 
round the world, in London and New York, in Africa and 
Brazil and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond the 
frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villages of 
the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and Japqn 
—everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, 
made monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling from birth 
to death and still singing. Out of those mighty loins a race of 
conscious beings must one day come. You were the dead: 
theirs was the future. But you could share in that future if 
you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and 
passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four. 

“We are the dead,” he said. 

“We are the dead,” echoed Julia dutifully. 

“You are the dead.” said an iron voice behind them. 

They sprang apart. Winston’s entrails seemed to have turned 
into ice. He could see the white all round the irises of Julia’s 
eyes. Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smear of 
rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply, 
almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath. 

“You are the' dead,” repeated the iron voice. 

“It was behind the picture,” breathed Julia. 

“It was behind the picture," said the voice. “Remain ex¬ 
actly where you are. Make no movement until you arc 

ordered.” , , . .. 

It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do not 

ing except stand gazing into one another s eyes. To run or 
life, to get out of the house before it was too late no sue 
thought occurred to them. Unthinkable to disobey the iron 
voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a eaten 

168 



# had been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The 
picture had fallen to the floor, uncovering the telescreen be¬ 
hind it. 


“Now they can see us," said Julia. 

“Now we can see you,” said the voice. “Stand out in the 
middle of the room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands 
behind your heads. Do not touch one another.” 

They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he 
could feel Julia’s body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely 
the shaking of his own. He could just stop his teeth from 
chattering, but his knees were beyond his control. There 
was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and 
outside. The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was 
being dragged across the stones. The woman’s singing had 
stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling clang, as though 
the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a con¬ 
fusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain. 

“The house is surrounded,” said Winston. 

“The house is surrounded,” said the voice. 

He heard Julia snap her teeth together. “I suppose we may 
as well say good-by,” she said. 


“You may as well say good-by,” said the voice. And then 
another quite different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which 
Winston had the impression of having heard before, struck 
•in: “And by the way, while we are on the subject. Here comes 
a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop 
off your head!” 

Something crashed on the bed behind Winston’s hack. The 
head of a ladder had been thrust through the window and 
had burst in the frame. Someone was climbing through the 
window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs. The 
room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod 
boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands. 

Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he 

barely moved. One thing alone mattered: to keep still, to 

Keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! A man 

with a smooth prizefighters jowl in which the mouth was 

2[.. a .. s,, , t P aused opposite him, balancing his truncheon 

S T-r/ ^ etwe ^ n thu ™ b and forefinger. Winston met his 

hpfrt T h n fee,, . n S° f nakedness, with one's hands behind one’s 

beamhle and „ hody nil exposed, was almost un- 

bearable. The man protruded the tip of a white toneue, licked 

on Thprp" hcre h,s bps should have been, and then passed 
on There was another crash. Someone had picked up the 

"file he P a™nf' ,able and smashed il P^ «" 


169 




The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar 
rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, 
thought Winston, how small it always was! There was a gasp' 
and a thump behind him, and he received a violent kick on 
the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of the 
men had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling 
her up like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the 
floor, fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn his head 
even by a millimeter, but sometimes her livid, gasping face 
came within the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was 
as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly 
pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to 
get back her breath. He knew what it was like: the terrible, 
agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not 
be suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to be 
able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her up by knees 
and shoulders and carried her out of the room like a sack. 
Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and 
contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge 
on either cheek; and that was the last he saw of her. 

He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts 
which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninter¬ 
esting began to flit through his mind. He wondered whether 
they had got Mr. Charrington. He wondered what they had 
done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly, 
wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had 
done so only two or three hours ago. He noticed that the 
clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one. 
But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light be fad¬ 
ing at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered 
whether after all he and Julia had mistaken the time had 
slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty when 
really it was nought eight-thirty on the following morning. 
But he did not pursue the thought further. It was not inter¬ 


esting. 

There was another, lighter step in the passage. Mr. C nar- 
rinuton came into the room. The demeanor of the black- 
uniformed men suddenly became more subdued. Something 
had also changed in Mr. Charrington's appearance. His eye 
fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight. 

“Pick up those pieces." he said sharply. 

A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disap¬ 
peared; Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that 
he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. r. 
Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but his. 
hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also 

170 



he was not wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single 
sharp glance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid 
t no more attention to him. He was still recognizable, but he 
was not the same person any longer. His body had straight¬ 
ened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had under¬ 
gone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a 
complete transformation. The black eyebrows were less 
bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face 
seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was 
the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It oc¬ 
curred to Winston that for the first time in his life he was 
looking, with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police. 


171 




r 


THREE 


He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in 
the Ministry of Love; but there was no way of making cer¬ 
tain. 


He was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with walls of 
glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps flooded it with 
cold light, and there was a low. steady humming sound which 
he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A 
bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the 
wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the 
door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. There were four 
telescreens, one in each wall. 

There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever 
since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven 


him away. But he was also hungry, with a gnawing, unwhole¬ 
some kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four hours since he 
had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know, 
probably never would know, whether it had been morning or 
evening when they arrested him. Since he was arrested he 
had not been fed. 

He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his 
hands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sit 
still. If you made unexpected movements they yelled at you 
from the telescreen. But the craving lor food was growing 
upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread. 
He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the 
pocket of his overalls. It was even possible—he thbught this 
because from time to time something seemed to tickle his 
leg—that there might be a sizable bit of crust there. In the 
end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slipped 


a hand into his pocket. 

’‘Smith!'’ yelled a voice from the telescreen. "6079 Smith 
W! Hands out of pockets in the cells!" 

He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Belore 
being brought here he had been taken to another place which 
must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up 
used by the patrols. He did not know how long he had been 
there; some hours, at any rate; with no clocks and no day¬ 
light it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smell¬ 
ing place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one n 




was now, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten 
« or fifteen people. The majority of them were common crimi¬ 
nals, but there were a few political prisoners among them. 
He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too 
preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much 
interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing 
difference in demeanor between the Party prisoners and the 
others. The Party prisoners were always silent and terrified, 
but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for any¬ 
body. They yelled insults at the guards, fought back fiercely 
when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene words 
on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from 
mysterious hiding places in their clothes, and even shouted 
down the telescreen when it tried to restore order. On the 
other hand, some of them seemed to be on good terms with 
the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle 
cigarettes through the spy-hole in the door. The guards, too, 
treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance, 
even when they had to handle them roughly. There was much 
talk about the forced-labor camps to which most of the 
prisoners expected to be sent. It was “all right" in the camps, 
he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the 
ropes. There were bribery, favoritism, and racketeering of 
every kind, there were homosexuality and prostitution, there 
«, was even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes. The positions 
of trust were given only to the common criminals, especially 
the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort of aris¬ 
tocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals. 

There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every 
description: drug peddlers, thieves, bandits, black marketeers, 
drunks, prostitutes. Some of the drunks were so violent that 
the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them. An 
enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with great 
tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had 
come down in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shout¬ 
ing, by four guards who had hold of her one at each corner. 
They wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying 
to kick them, and dumped her down across Winston’s lap, 
almost breaking his thighbones. The woman hoisted herself 
upright and followed them out with a yell of “F- bas¬ 

tards!” Then, noticing that she was sitting on something un¬ 
even, she slid off Winston’s knees onto the bench. 

“Beg pardon, dearie," she said. “I wouldn’t ’a sat on you, 
only the buggers put me there. They dono ’ow to treat a 
K. Jady, do they?” She paused, patted her breast, and belched. 

Pardon,” she said, “I ain’t meself, quite.” 

173 



She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor. 

"Thass better.” she said, leaning back with closed eyes. 
"Never keep it down, thass what I say. Get it up while it's * 
fresh on your stomach, like.” 

She revived, turned to have another look at Winston, and 
seemed immediately to take a fancy to him. She put a vast 
arm round his shoulder and drew him toward her, breathing 
beer and vomit into his face. 

“Wass your name, dearie?” she said. 

“Smith,” said Winston. 

“Smith?” said the woman. “Thass funny. My name's Smith 
too. Why,” she added sentimentally, “I might be your mother!” 

She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about 
the right age and physique, and it was probable that people 
changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-labor camp. 

No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the 
ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners. “The pol/fs,” 
they called them, with a sort of uninterested contempt. The 
Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody, and 
. above all of speaking to one another. Only once, when two 
Party members, both women, were pressed close together on 
the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hur¬ 
riedly whispered words; and in particular a reference to some¬ 
thing called “room one-oh-one,” which he did not under¬ 
stand. 

It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought* - 
him here. The dull pain in his belly never went away, but 
sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and his 
thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When it grew 
worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for 
food. When it grew better, panic took hold ol him. There 
were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen 
to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his 
breath stopped. He felt the smash of truncheons on his 
elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; h&lt;i. saw himself 
crovcling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken 
teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind 
on her. He loved her and would not betray her; but that was 
only a fact, known as he knew the rules of arithmetic. He . 
felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered what was 
happening to her. He thought oftener of O’Brien, with a 
flickering hope. O'Brien must know that lie had been arrested. 
The Brotherhood, he had said, never tried to save its mem¬ 
bers But there was the razor blade; they would send the 
razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five. sec- 
onds before the guards could rush into the cell. The bla 

174 



would bite into him with a sort of burning c °' dncss p ™ d , C h ^" 
the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone. Everything 
tame back to his sick body, which shrank trembling from 
the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would use the 
razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural 
to exist from moment to moment, accepting another ten min¬ 
utes’ life even with the certainty that there was torture at tne 


WSIU ut ll. - 1 ; 

Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain 
bricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but 
he always lost count at some point or another. More often 
he wondered where he was. and what time of day it was. At 
one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, 
and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In 
this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be 
turned out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw now 
why O’Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the 
Ministry of Love there were no windows. His cell might be 
at the heart of the building, or against its outer wall: it might 
be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved 
himself mentally from place to place, and tried to determine 
by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in 
the air or buried deep underground. 

There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel 
door opened with a clang. A young officer, a trim black- 
uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished 
leather and whose pale, straight-featured face was like a 
wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He mo¬ 
tioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they 
were leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. 
The door clanged shut again. 

Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from 
side to side, as though having some idea that there was another 
door to go out of, and then began to wander up and down 
the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston’s presence. His 
troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a meter above 
the level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes 
were sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several 
days away from a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to 
the cheekbones, giving him an air of ruffianism that went 
oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements. 

Winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. He must 
speak to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. 
It was even conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of 
the fazor blade. 

Y “Ampleforth,” he said. 


175 


There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, 
mildly startled. His eyes focused themselves slowly on Win¬ 
ston. 

“Ah, Smith!” he said. "You, too!" 

“What are you in for?” 

“To tell you the truth—” He sat down awkwardly on the 
bench opposite Winston. “There is only one offense, is there 
not?” he said. 

“And have you committed it?" 

“Apparently I have.” 

He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for 
a moment, as though trying to remember something. 

“These things happen," he began vaguely. “I have been 
able to recall one instance—a possible instance. It was an 
indiscretion, undoubtedly. We were producing a definitive 
edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the word ‘God’ 
to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!” he added 
almost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. “It 
was impossible to change the line. The rhyme was ‘rod.’ Do 
you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to ‘rod’ in the 
entire language? For days I had racked my brains. There was 
no other rhyme.” 

The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed 
out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort 
of intellectual warmth, the joy of the pedant who has found 
out some useless fact, shone through the dirt and scrubby 
hair. 

“Has it ever occurred to you,” he said, "that the whole 
history of English poetry has been determined by the fact that 
the English language lacks rhymes?” 

No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. 
Nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as very important 
or interesting. 

“Do you know what time of day it is?” he said. 

Ampleforth looked startled again. “I had hardly thought 
about it. They arrested me—it could be two days ago—per¬ 
haps three.” His eyes flitted round the walls, as though he 
half expected to find a window somewhere. “There is no dif¬ 
ference between night and day in this place. I do not see 

how one can calculate the time.’ 

They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without 
apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be 
silent. Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. Am P* cforth ’ 
too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgeted 
from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one knee, 
then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep 

176 


still. Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour—it was difficult 
to judge. Once more there was a sound of boots outside. 
Winston's entrails contracted. Soon, very soon, perhaps in 
five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would mean 

that his own turn had come. 

The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped 
into the cell. With a brief movement of the hand he indicated 
Ampleforth. 

“Room 101,” he said. 

Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his 
face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending. 

What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Win¬ 
ston’s belly had revived. His mind sagged round and round 
on the same track, like a ball falling again and again into 
the same series of slots. He had only six thoughts. 1 he pain 
in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming: 
O'Brien; Julia: the razor blade. There was another spasm 
in his entrails: the heavy boots were approaching. As the door 
opened, the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful 
smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into the cell. He was 
wearing khaki shorts and a sports shirt. 

This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness. 

"You here!” he said. 

Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither 
interest or surprise, but only misery. He began walking 
^jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still. Each 
time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that 
they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look, 
as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at some¬ 
thing in the middle distance. 

“What are you in for?” said Winston. 

“Thoughtcrime!” said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone 
of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his guilt 
and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be 
applied to himself. He paused opposite Winston and began 
eagerly appealing to him: “You don't think they’ll shoot me. 
do you, old chap? They don't shoot you if you haven't 
actually done anything—only thoughts, which you can’t help? 
I know they give you a fair hearing. Oh, I trust them for that! 
They’ll know my record, won’t they? You know what kind of 
a chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of 
course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party, didn't 
I? I'll get off with five years, don’t you think? Or even ten 
years? A chap like me could make himself pretty useful in a 
labor camp. They wouldn't shoot me for going off the rails 
^just once?” 


177 


“Are you guilty?” said Winston. 

“Of course I'm guilty!” cried Parsons with a servile glance 
at the telescreen. “You don't think the Party would arrest . 
an innocent man, do you?” His froglike face grew calmer, 
and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression 
“Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,” he said senten- 
tiously. “It’s insidious. It can get hold of you without your 
even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my 
sleep! Yes, that's a fact. There I was, working away, trying to 
do my bit—never knew I had any bad stuff in my mind at all. 
And then I started talking in my sleep. Do you know what 


they heard me saying?" 

He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical 

reasons to utter an obscenity. 

“ 'Down with Big Brother!’ Yes, I said that! Said it over 
and over again, it seems. Between you and me, old man, I m 
glad they got me before it went any further. Do you know 
what I'm going to say to them when I go up before the 
tribunal? ‘Thank you,’ I’m going to say, ‘thank you for sav¬ 
ing me before it was too late.’ ” 

“Who denounced you?” said Winston. 

“It was my little daughter,” said Parsons with a sort of 
doleful pride. “She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I 
was saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day. 
Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh? I don’t bear her any 
grudge for it. In fact I'm proud of her. It shows I brought- 

her up in the right spirit, anyway.” 

He made a ~few more jerky movements up and down, 
several times casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan. 
Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts. 

“Excuse me, old man,” he said. “I cant help it. Its th 

^He flumped his large posteriors onto the lavatory pan. 

Winston covered his face with his hands. .w- n7Q 

“Smith!” yelled the voice from the telescreeni 6 

Smith W! Uncover your face. No faces covered in the cell^ 
Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used he lavatory, 
loudly and abundantly. It then turned out that the plug was 
defective, and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards. 

Parsons was removed. More prisoners cam „ 

mysteriously. One, a woman, was consigned to Roomwi. 
and Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a different 
color when she heard the words. A time came when, if it had 
been morning when he was brought here it would be aft 
noon if it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight 
There were six prisoners in the cell, men and women. All sat 

178 


very still. Opposite Winston there sat a man with a chinless, 
toothy face exactly like that of some large, harmless rodent, 
ft is fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that 
it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food 
tucked away there. His pale-gray eyes flitted timorously from 
face to face, and turned quickly away again when he caught 

anyone’s eye. . 

The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in 
whose appearance sent a momentary chill through Winston. 
He was a commonplace, mean-looking man who might have 
been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what was 
startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. 
Because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked dispro¬ 
portionately large, and the eyes seemed filled with a murder¬ 
ous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or something. 

The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from 
Winston. Winston did not look at him again, but the tor¬ 
mented, skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as though 
it had been straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he realized 
what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation. The 
same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to 
everyone in the cell. There was a very faint stirring all the 
way round the bench. The eyes of the chinless man kept 
flitting toward the skull-faced man. then turning guiltily away, 
then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction. Present¬ 
ly he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up, waddled 
clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his over¬ 
alls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread 
to the skull-faced man. 

There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. 
The chinless man jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man 
had quickly thrust his hands behind his back, as though 
demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift. 

“Bumstead!” roared the voice. "2713 Bumstead J! Let fall 
that piece of bread.” 

The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor. 

"Remain standing where you arc,” said the voice. “Face 
the door. Make no movement.” 

The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were 
quivering uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the 
young officer entered and stepped aside, there emerged from 
behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and 
shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man, and 
then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, 
\yith alPthe weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless 
man's mouth. The force of it seemed almost to knock him 

179 



clear of the floor. His body was flung across the cell and 
fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat. For a mo&lt; 
ment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from 
his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, 
which seemed unconscious, came out of him. Then he rolled 
over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid 
a stream of blood and saliva, the two halves of a dental plate 
fell out of his mouth. 

The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their 
knees. The chinless man climbed back into his place. Down 
one side of his face the flesh was darkening. His mouth had 
swollen into a shapeless cherry-colored mass with a black 
hole in the middle of it. From time to time a little blood 
dripped onto the breast of his overalls. His gray eyes still 
flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever, as though 
he were trying to discover how much the others despised him 
for his humiliation. 

The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated 
the skull-faced man. 

“Room 101,” he said. 

There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston’s side. The man 
had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his 
hands clasDed toeether. 

“Comrade! Officer!” he cried. “You don’t have to take me 
to that place! Haven’t I told you everything already? Wha* 
else is it you want to know? There’s nothing I wouldn t con¬ 
fess, nothing! Just tell me what it is and I’ll confess it straight 
off. Write it down and I'll sign it—anything! Not room 101!" 

“Room 101,” said the officer. 

The man’s face, already very pale, turned a color Winston 
would not have believed possible. It was definitely, unmistak¬ 
ably. a shade of green. 

“Do anything to me!” he yelled. “You’ve been starving me 
for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. 
Sentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody else you 
want me to give away? Just say who it is and I'll tell you any¬ 
thing you want. I don’t care who it is or what you do to them. 
I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn 
six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut 
their throats in front of my eyes, and I’ll stand by and watch 

it. But not room 101!” 

“Room 101,” said the officer. 

The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, 
as thoueh with some idea that he could put another victim in 
his own place. His eyes settled on the smashed face ot tt* 
chinless man. He flung out a lean arm. 

180 


“That’s the one you ought to be taking, not me!” he shout¬ 
ed. “You didn’t hear what he was saying after they bashed 
his face. Give me a chance and I’ll tell you every word of it. 
He's the one that’s against the Party, not me.” The guards 
stepped forward. The man’s voice rose to a shriek. “You 
didn’t hear him!” he repeated. “Something went wrong with 
the telescreen. He’s the one you want. Take him, not me!” 

The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the 
arms. But just at this moment he flung himself across the 
floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that sup¬ 
ported the bench. He had set up a wordless howling, like an 
animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, 
but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty 
seconds they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, 
their hands crossed on their knees, looking straight in front 
of them. The howling stopped; the man had no breath left 
for anything except hanging on. Then there was a different 
kind of cry. A kick from a guard’s boot had broken the fingers 
of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet. 

“Room 101,” said the officer. 

The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, 
nursing his crushed hand, all the fight gone out of him. 

A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the 
skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning; if morning, 
it was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been alone 
for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such 
that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the 
telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinlcss 
man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort 
not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His 
mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. The humming sound and 
the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness, an 
empty feeling inside his head. He would get up because the 
ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would 
sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to 
make sure of staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensa¬ 
tions were a little under control the terror returned. Sometimes 
with a fading hope he thought of O'Brien and the razor blade. 
It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed 
in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought of 
Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering, perhaps far 
worse than he. She might be screaming with pain at this 
moment. He thought: “If I could save Julia by doubling my 
own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.” But that was merely 
an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought 
to take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel 

181 


anything, except pain and the foreknowledge of pain. Be¬ 
sides, was it possible, when you were actually suffering it, to p 
wish for any reason whatever that your own pain should 
increase? But that question was not answerable yet. 

The boots were approaching again. The door opened. 

O’Brien came in. . , 

Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had 
driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many years 
he forgot the presence of the telescreen. 

“They've got you too!” he cried. 

“They got me a long time ago,” said O Brien with a mild, 
almost regretful irony. He stepped aside. From behind him 
there emerged a broad-chested guard with a long blacK 
truncheon in his hand. 

“You knew this. Winston,” said O'Brien. Don t deceive 
vourself. You did know it—you have always known it. 

Yes he saw now, he had always known it. But there was 
no time to think of that. All he had eyes for was the trun¬ 
cheon in the guard’s hand. It might fall anywhere: on the 
crown, on the tip of the ear. on the upper arm on the elbow— 

The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralyzed, 
clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand. Ev ^ hin g 

had exploded into vcllow light. Inconceivable, inconceivable 

that one blow could cause such pain! The light beared and 
he could see the other two looking down at him. The gua ^ 
was laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate 
was answered. Never, for any reason on earth. could1 you 
wish for an increase of pain. Of pain you coukl w. h only one 
thing- that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so bad 
as physical pain. In the face of pain there arc no h ^’ n0 
heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed on the floor, 
clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm. 


He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, 
except that it wfs higher off the ground and that he was fixed 

Ewx rrx 

hY ?SSes were open he took in his surrounding 

only gradually. He had the |”^^‘'7Sl n Sf U „ P ni e p , 

wi S ,e r r 00 w m or,dTar bTneaTh it. How long he had been down 

182 



there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested 
him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides his memo- 
. -ies were not continuous. There had been times when con¬ 
sciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has in 
sleep, had stopped dead and started again alter a blank in¬ 
terval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or 

only seconds, there was no way of knowing. 

With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. 
Later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely 
a preliminary, a routine interrogation to which nearly all 
prisoners were subjected. There was a long range of crimes 
espionage, sabotage, and the like—to which everyone had tc 
confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality 
though the torture was real. How many times he had beer, 
beaten, how long the beatings had continued, he could not 
remember. Always there were five or six men in black uni 
forms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was fists, some 
times it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, some 
times it was boots. There were times when he rolled about 
the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his body this 
way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks 
and simply inviting more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in 
his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin, in his 
testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times 
when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable 
/•thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat 
him but that he could not force himself into losing conscious¬ 
ness. There were times when his nerve so forsook him that he 
began shouting for mercy even before the beating began 
when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow wa‘ 
enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and 
imaginary crimes. There were other times when he started 
out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word 
had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there 
were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he 
said to himself: “I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out 
till the pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more 
kicks, and then I will tell them what they want.” Sometimes 
he was beaten till he could hardly stand, then flung like a 
sack of potatoes onto the stone floor of a cell, left to recuper¬ 
ate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again 
There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered 
them dimly, because they were spent chiefly in sleep oi 
stupor. He remembered a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shell 
sticking out from the wall, and a tin washbasin, and meals ol 
r hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. He remembered s 

183 


surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crcp his hair, and 
businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling ni^ 
pulse, tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running 
harsh fingers over him in search of broken bones, and shoot- 

ins needles into his arm to make him sleep. 

The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a 
threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any mo¬ 
ment when his answers were unsatisfactory. His questioners 
now were not ruffians in black uniforms but Party intellectuals, 
little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spec¬ 
tacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which 
lasted—he thought, he could not be sure—ten or twelve hours 
at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that he was in 
constant slisht pain, but it was not chiefly pam that they 
relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled his 
hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, 
shone olarine lights in his face until his eyes ran with water, 
but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and desuoy 

his power of arguing and reasonmg. Their realafter 
ihe merciless questioning that went on and on hour alter 
hour tripping him up, laying traps for him, twistingevery 
thing that he said, convicting him at every step of lies andI self 

contradiction, until he began weeping as much fr ^J han1 ]f 
as from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half 
a dozen times in a single session. Most of the t me y 

screamed abuse at him and threatened at . 
deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes th 
would suddenly change their tune call htrn comrade app a^ 
,o him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him 

sorrowfully whether even now he had not en( ? u S h ^ d ^ nc

It was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody. 
Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was true that he had been 
the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party there 
was no distinction between the thought and the deed. 

There were also memories of another kind. They stood out 
in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all 
round them. 

He was in a cell which might have been either dark or 
light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near 
at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slow'ly and reg¬ 
ularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous. Suddenly 
he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swal¬ 
lowed up. 

He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under 
dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials. 
There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged 
open. The waxen-faced officer marched in, followed by two 
guards. 

“Room 101,” said the officer. 

The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not 
^Jook at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials. 

He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometer wide, 
full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter and shout¬ 
ing out confessions at the top of his voice. He was confessing 
everything, even the things he had succeeded in holding back 
under the torture. He was relating the entire history of his 
life to an audience who knew it already. With him were the 
guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, O'Brien, 
Julia, Mr. Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together 
and shouting with laughter. Some dreadful thing which had 
lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over 
and had not happened. Everything was all right, there was no 
more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare, understood, 
forgiven. 

He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-cer¬ 
tainty that he had heard O'Brien’s voice. All through his in¬ 
terrogation, although he had never seen him, he had had the 
feeling that O’Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. It was 
O’Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the 
guards onto Winston and who prevented them from killing 
^him. It was he who decided when Winston should scream 
with pain, when he should have a respite, when he should be 

185 


fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped 
into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and suggestec 
the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he 
was the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once Winston 
could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep, or in 
normal sleep, or even in a moment of wakefulness—a voice 
murmured in his ear: “Don't worry. Winston; you are in my 
keepina. For seven years I have watched over you Now the 

turnine point has come. I shall save you . I _ s . ha, . , c V \ 

perfect." He was not sure whether it was O Brien s voice, but 
it was the same voice that had said to him Weshall meet 
in the place where there is no darkness, in that other dream, 

SC He y d C id S not 0 'remember any ending to his interrogation. 
There was a period of blackness and then the cell or room, 
in which he now was had gradually materialized round him. 
He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move. H's body 
was held down at every essential point. Even the back of 
head was gripped in some manner. OBnen was looking down 
at him gravely and rather sadly. His face. seen from.below. 
looked coarse and worn, with pouches under 1 y ; ‘ 
tired lines from nose to chin. He was older than Winstonhad 
thoueht him: he was perhaps forty-eight or fiftH Uncer his 
hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures runnin,

dial. The wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it had 
come. 

&lt; “That was forty,” said O'Brien. “You can sec that the num¬ 
bers on this dial run up to a hundred. Will you please remem¬ 
ber. throughout our conversation, that l have it in my power 
to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree 
I choose. If you tell me any lies, or attempt to prevaricate in 
any way, or even fall below your usual level of intelligence, 
you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understand that?” 

“Yes,” said Winston. 

O'Brien’s manner became less severe. He resettled his 
spectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. 
When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. He had the 
air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to explain 
and persuade rather than to punish. 

“I am taking trouble with you, Winston." he said, “because 
you are worth trouble. You know perfectly well what is the 
matter with you. You have known it for years, though you have 
fought against the knowledge. You arc mentally deranged. 
You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable to re¬ 
member real events, and you persuade yourself that you re¬ 
member other events which never happened. Fortunately it 
is curable. You have never cured yourself of it, because you 
did not choose to. There was a small effort of the will that 
you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware, you 
ffrre clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a 
virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, which 
power is Oceania at war with?” 

“When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia ” 
With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at 
war with Eastasia, has it not?” 

Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak 

and then did not speak. He could not take his eyes away from 
the dial. } 


The truth, please, Winston. Your truth. Tell me what you 
think you remember.” 

I remember that until only a week before I was arrested 
we were not at war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance 
with them. The war was against Eurasia. That had lasted for 
four years. Before that—” 

?A Br * e iP sto PP ed w *th a movement of the hand

RmherfnrH me mcmbers named Jones, Aaronson, and 

d i?" Wh u° r re executed for treachery and sab¬

guilty of the crimes they were charged with. You believed 
that you had seen unmistakab'e documentary evidence prov¬ 
ing that their confessions were false. There was a certain 
photograph about which you had a hallucination. You be¬ 
lieved that you had actually held it in your hands. It was 
a photograph something like this.” 

An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between 
O'Brien’s fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within the 
angle of Winston's vision. It was a photograph, and there 
was no question of its identity. It was the photograph. It 
was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, 
and Rutherford at the Party function in New York, which 
he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly de¬ 
stroyed. For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it 
was out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably 
he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench 
the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so 
much as a centimeter in any direction. For the moment he 
had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the 
photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it. 

“It exists!” he cried. 

“No,” said O'Brien. 

He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole 
in the opposite wall. O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the 
frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm 
air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame. O Brien turned away 

from the wall. _ 

“Ashes,” he said. “Not even identifiable ashes. Dust, n 

does not exist. It never existed.” 

“But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory, i re¬ 
member it. You remember it.” 

“I do not remember it,” said O Brien. , 

Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a 
feeling of deadly helplessness. If he could have been certain 
that O'Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter 
But it was perfectly possible that O Brien had really forgo 
the photograph. And if so, then already he would have tor- 
gotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act or 
forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simply trickery. 
Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really p 

pen: that was the thought that defeated him. 

O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than 
ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a waywar 

but promising child. .if 

“There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of tl? 

past,” he said. “Repeat it, if you please.” 

188 


‘“Who controls the past controls the future; who controls 
the present controls the past,’ ” repeated Winston obediently. 

“ 'Who controls the present controls the past,’ ” said O'Brien, 
nodding his head with slow approval. “Is it your opinion, 
Winston, that the past has real existence?" 

Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. 
His eyes flitted toward the dial. He not only did not know 
whether “yes” or "no" was the answer that would save him 

from pain; he did not even know which answer he believed to 
be the true one. 

O Brien smiled faintly. "You arc no metaphysician, Win¬ 
ston, he said. “Until this moment you had never considered 
what is meant by existence. I will put it more precisely. Does 
the past exist concretely, in space? Is there somewhere or 

other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still 
happening?” 

“No.” 


“Then where does the past exist, if at all?” 

“In records. It is written down.” 

"In records. And—?” 

In the mind. In human memories.” 

“In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control an 
records, and we control all memories. Then we control the 
past, do we not?” 

"But how can you stop people remembering things?" cried 
-Winston, again momentarily forgetting the dial. “It is in- 
voluntary It is outside oneself. How can you control mem¬ 
ory/ You have not controlled mine!”

of the Party. That is the fact that you have got to relearn, 
Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the 
will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane." 

He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he 
had been saying to sink in. 

“Do you remember,” he went on, “writing in your diary, 
‘Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four’?” 

"Yes,” said Winston. 

O'Brien held up his left hand, its back toward Winston, 
with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended. 

“How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?” 

“Four.” 

“And if the Party says that it is not four but five—then how 
many?” 

“Four.” 

The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial 
had shot up to fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over 
Winston’s body. The air tore into his lungs and issued again 
in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could 
not stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended. 
He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly 
eased. 

“How many fingers, Winston?” 

“Four.” 

The needle went up to sixty. 

“How many fingers, Winston?” 

“Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!” 

The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. 
The heavy, stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. 
The fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars, enormous, 
blurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four. 

“How many fingers, Winston?" 

“Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four. 

“How many fingers, Winston?” 

“Five! Five! Five!” 

“No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think 
there arc four. How many fingers, please?” 

“Four! Five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop 


the pain!” . , , . . 

Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien s arm round his 

shoulders. He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few sec¬ 
onds. The bonds that had held his body down were loosened. 
He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his teetn 
were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For 
a moment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously com¬ 
forted by the heavy arm round his shoulders. He had ttfc 

190 


feeling that O'Brien was his protector, that the pain was some¬ 
thing "that came from outside, from some other source, and 
that it was O'Brien who would save him from it. 

"You are a slow learner. Winston." said O’Brien gently. 

“How can I help it?" he blubbered. "How can 1 help see¬ 
ing what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are tour. 

"Sometimes. Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes 
they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You 
must try harder. It is not easy to become sane." 

He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip on his limbs 
tightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the trem¬ 
bling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold. O Brien 
motioned with his head to the man in the white coat, who 
had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in 
the while coat bent down and looked closely into Winston s 
eyes, felt his pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here 
and there; then he nodded to O'Brien. 

“Again,” said O'Brien. 

The pain flowed into Winston's body. The needle must be 
at seventy, seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He 
knew that the fingers were still there, and still four. All that 
mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was 
over. He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or 
not. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O'Brien had 
drawn back the lever. 

1 "How many fingers, Winston?" 

“Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could. 

I am trying to see five.” 

“Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or 
really to sec them?" 

"Really to sec them.” 

"Again,” said O'Brien. 

Perhaps the needle was at eighty—ninety. Winston could 
only intermittently remember why the pain was happening. 
Behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be 
moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disappearing 
behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying to 
count them, he could not remember why. He knew only that 
it was impossible to count them, and that this was somehow 
due to the mysterious identity between five and four. The 
pain died down again. When he opened his eyes it was to find 
that he was still seeing the same thing. Innumerable fingers, 
like moving trees, were still streaming past in either direction, 
crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes again. 

' “How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?” 

191 • . - 


“I don’t know. I don’t know. You will kill me if you do 
that again. Four, five, six—in all honesty I don’t know.” 

“Better,” said O’Brien. 

A needle slid into Winston’s arm. Almost in the same in¬ 
stant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body. 
The pain was already half-forgotten. He opened his eyes and 
looked up gratefully at O’Brien. At sight of the heavy, lined 
face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over 
If he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand 
and laid it on O’Brien’s arm. He had never loved him so deeply 
as at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the 
pain. The old feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether 
O’Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back. O'Brien 
was a person who could be talked to. Perhaps one did not want 
to be loved so much as to be understood. O’Brien had tor¬ 
tured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was 
certain, he would send him to his death. It made no differ 
ence. In some sense that went deeper than friendship, they 
were intimates; somewhere or other, although the actual words 
might never be spoken, there was a place where they could 
meet and talk. O’Brien was looking down at him with an c.\ 
pression which suggested that the same thought might be in 
his own mind. When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational 


tone. . 

“Do you know where you are, Winston?” he said. ^ 

“I don’t know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love. 

“Do you know how long you have been here?” 

“I don’t know. Days, weeks, months—I think it is months. 
“And why do you imagine that we bring people to this 

place?” 

“To make them confess.” 

“No, that is not the reason. Try again.” 


“To punish them.” .. 

“No'” exclaimed O’Brien. His voice had changed extraordi¬ 
narily, and his face had suddenly become both stern and 
animated. “No! Not merely to extract your confession, nor to 
punish you. Shall I tell you why we have brought you here/ 
To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand. Win 
ston, that no one whom we bring to this place everReaves our

seen from below. Moreover it was filled with a _sort of exalta 
tion, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston s heart shrank. If it 
'had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed. 
He felt certain that O'Brien was about to twist the dial out o 
sheer wantonness. At this moment, however O Bnen turned 
away. He took a pace or two up and down. Then he continued 

less vehemently: ... . ... . 

“The first thing for you to understand is that in this place 

there are no martyrdoms. You have read of the religious 
persecutions of the past. In the Middle Ages there was the 
Inquisition. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate heresy, and 
ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at the 
stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that. Because 
the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them 
while they were still unrepentant; in fact, it killed them be¬ 
cause they were unrepentant. Men were dying because they 
would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory 
belonged to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor who 
burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there were the 
totalitarian, as they were called. There were the German 
Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted 
heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition had done. And they 
imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past, 
they knew, at any rate, that one must not make martyrs. 
Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they delib¬ 
erately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them 
down by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cring¬ 
ing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths, 
covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering be¬ 
hind one another, whimpering for mercy. And yet after only a 
few years the same thing had happened over again. The dead 
men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. 
Once again, why was it? In the first place, because the con¬ 
fessions that they had made were obviously extorted and un¬ 
true. We do not make mistakes of that kind. All the confes¬ 
sions that are uttered here are true. We make them true. And, 
above all, we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You 
must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Win¬ 
ston. Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted 
clean out from the stream of history. We shall turn you into 
gas and pour you into the stratosphere. Nothing will remain 
of you: not a name in a register, not a memory in a living 
brain. You will be annihilated in the past as well as in the 
future. You will never have existed.” 

Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a 
momentary bitterness. O’Brien checked his step as though 

193 


1 


Winston had uttered the thought aloud. His large ugly face 
came nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed. 

You are thinking,” he said, “that since we intend to de-* 
stroy you utterly, so that nothing that you say or do can 
make the smallest difference—in that case, why do we go to 
the trouble of interrogating you first? That is what you were 
thinking, was it not?” 

“Yes,” said Winston. 

O Brien smiled slightly. “You are a flaw in the pattern, 
Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not 
tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of 
the past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor 
even with the most abject submission. When finally you sur¬ 
render to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not de¬ 
stroy the heretic because he resists us; so long as he resists 
us we never destroy him. We convert him, we capture his 
inner mind, we reshape him. We bum all evil and all il¬ 
lusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in ap¬ 
pearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one 
of ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that 
an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, 
however secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instant 
of death we cannot permit any deviation. In the old days the 
heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his 
heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges 
could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked dowtf 
the passage waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain 
perfect before we blow it out. The command of the old des¬ 
potisms was ‘Thou shalt not.’ The command of the totalitarians 
was Thou shalt.’ Our command is 'Thou art.’ No one whom 
we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone 
is washed clean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose 
innocence you once believed—Jones, Aaronson, and Ruther¬ 
ford—in the end we broke them down. I took part in their 
interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down, whim¬ 
pering, groveling, weeping—and in the end it was not with 
pain or fear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished 
with them they were only the shells of men. There was noth¬ 
ing left in them except sorrow for what they had done, and 
love of Big Brother. It was touching to see how they loved 
him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die 
while their minds were still clean.” 

His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the 
lunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face. He is not pretending, 
thought Winston; he is not a hypocrite; he believes every word 
he says. What most oppressed him was the consciousness of 

194 



his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavy yet 
graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range 
v.of his vision. O’Brien was a being in all ways larger than him¬ 
self. There was no idea that he had ever had, or could have, 
that O’Brien had not long ago known, examined, and re¬ 
jected. His mind contained Winston’s mind. But in that case 
how could it be true that O’Brien was mad? It must be he, 
Winston, who was mad. O'Brien halted and looked down at 
him. His voice had grown stem again. 

“Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, 
however completely you surrender to us. No one who has 
once gone astray is ever spared. And even if we chose to let 
you live out the natural term of your life, still you would 
never escape from us. What happens to you here is forever. 
Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the 
point from which there is no coming back. Things will happen 
to you from which you could not recover, if you lived a 
thousand years. Never again will you be capable of ordinary 
human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never 
again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of liv¬ 
ing, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You 
will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we 
shall fill you with ourselves.” 

He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Win¬ 
ston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed 
,~into place behind his head. O’Brien had sat down beside the 
bed, so that his face was almost on a level with Winston’s. 

“Three thousand,” he said, speaking over Winston’s head 
to the man in the white coat. 

Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped them¬ 
selves against Winston’s temples. He quailed. There was pain 
coming, a new kind of pain. O’Brien laid a hand reassuringly, 
almost kindly, on his. 

“This time it will not hurt,” he said. “Keep your eyes fixed 
on mine.” 

At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what 
seemed like an explosion, though it was not certain whether 
there was any noise. There was undoubtedly a blinding flash 
of light Winston was not hurt, only prostrated. Although he 
had already been lying on his back when the thing happened, 
he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that 
position. A terrific, painless blow had flattened him out. Also 
something had happened inside his head. As his eyes regained 
their focus he remembered who he was, and where he was 
and recognized the face that was gazing into his own; but 

195 




somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness, as 
though a piece had been taken out of his brain. 

It will not last,” said O'Brien. ‘‘Look me in the eyes. What 
country is Oceania at war with?” 

Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania, 
and that he himself was a citizen of Oceania. He also re¬ 
membered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was at war with 
whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that 
there was any war. 

“I don’t remember.” 

“Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Do you remember that 
now?” 

“Yes.” 

“Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since the 
beginning of your life, since the beginning of the Party, since 
the beginning of history, the war has continued without a 
break, always the same war. Do you remember that?” 

“Yes.” 

“Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men 
who had been condemned to death for treachery. You pre¬ 
tended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them 
innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed. You invented 
it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember now 
the very moment at which you first invented it. Do you re¬ 
member that?” 

“Yes.” 

“Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You 
saw five fingers. Do you remember that?” 

“Yes.” 

O'Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb 
concealed. 

“There are five fineers there. Do you see five fingers?” 

“Yes.” 

And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the 
scenery of his mind changed. He saw five fingers, and there 
was no deformity. Then everything was normal again, and 
the old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came crowd¬ 
ing back again. But there had been a moment—he did not 
know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps—of luminous cer¬ 
tainty, when each new suggestion of O’Brien’s had filled up a 
patch of emptiness and become absolute truth, and when two 
and two could have been three as easily as five, if that were 
what was needed. It had faded out before O'Brien had 
dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he 
could remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at 

196 



some remote period of one’s life when one was in effect a 
different person. 

y “You see now,” said O’Brien, “that it is at any rate pos¬ 
sible.” 

“Yes,” said Winston. 

O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left Win¬ 
ston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw 
back the plunger of a syringe. O’Brien turned to Winston with 
a smile. In almost the old manner he resettled his spectacles 
on his nose. 

“Do you remember writing in your diary," he said, “that 
it did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy, since 
I was at least a person who understood you and could be 
talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to you. Your mind 
appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you 
happen to be insane. Before we bring the session to an end 
you can ask me a few questions, if you choose.” 

“Any question I like?” 

“Anything.” He saw that Winston’s eyes were upon the dial. 
“It is switched off. What is your first question?” 

“What have you done with Julia?” said Winston. 

O’Brien smiled again. “She betrayed you, Winston. Im¬ 
mediately—unreservedly. I have seldom seen anyone come 
over to us so promptly. You would hardly recognize her if 
k v ou saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her folly, her 
dirty-mindedness—everything has been burned out of her. 
It was a perfect conversion, a textbook case.” 

“You tortured her.” 


O’Brien left this unanswered. “Next question," he said. 

“Does Big Brother exist?" 

“Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the em¬ 
bodiment of the Party.” 

“Does he exist in the same way as I exist?" 

“You do not exist,” said O’Brien. 

Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, 
or he could imagine, the arguments which proved his own 
nonexistence; but they were nonsense, they were only a play 
on words. Did not the statement, “You do not exist,” contain 
a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so? His mind 
shriveled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments 
with which O’Brien would demolish him. 


I think I exist, he said wearily. “I am conscious of my 
own identity. I was born, and I shall die. I have arms and 
legs.- I occupy a particular point in space. No other solid 
^.object can occupy the same point simultaneously. In that 
sense, does Big Brother exist?” 3 


197 


“It is of no importance. He exists.” 

“Will Big Brother ever die?” 

“Of course not. How could he die? Next question.” 

“Does the Brotherhood exist?” 

"That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set 
you free when we have finished with you, and if you live to 
be ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the an¬ 
swer to that question is Yes or No. As long as you live, it 
will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.” 

Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. 
He still had not asked the question that had come into his 
mind the first. He had got to ask it, and yet it was as though 
his tongue would not utter it. There was a trace of amusement 
in O’Brien’s face. Even his spectacles seemed to wear an 
ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he 
knows what I am going to ask! At the thought the words burst 
out of him: 

“What is in Room 101?” 

The expression on O'Brien’s face did not change. He an¬ 
swered drily: 

“You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone knows 
what is in Room 101.” 

He raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidently 
the session was at an end. A needle jerked into Winston’s arm. 
He sank almost instantly into deep sleep.

"There are three stages in your reintegration,” said O Brien. 
“There is learning, there is understanding, and there is ^ac¬ 
ceptance. It is time for you to enter upon the second stage.” 

As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late 
his bonds were looser. They still held him to the bed, but he 
could move his knees a little and could turn his head from 
side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. The dial, also, 
had grown to be less of a terror. He could evade its pangs it 
he was quick-witted enough; it was chiefly when he showed 
stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got 
through a whole session without use of the dial. He could 
not remember how many sessions there had been. The whole 
process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite time 
weeks, possibly—and the intervals between the sessions might 
sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two 
“As you lie there,” said O'Brien, “you have often wondered 

_you have even asked me—why the Ministry of Love should 

expend so much time and trouble on you. And when you were 

198 



free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same ques¬ 
tion. You could grasp the mechanics of the society you lived 
ii , but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing 
in your diary, ‘I understand how; I do not understand why ? 
It was when you thought about ‘why’ that you doubted your 
own sanity. You have read the book, Goldstein’s book, or 
parts of it, at least. Did it tell you anything that you did not 
know already?” 

‘‘You have read it?” said Winston. 

‘‘I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. No 
book is produced individually, as you know.” 

‘‘Is it true, what it says?” 

‘‘As description, yes. The program it sets forth is nonsense. 
The secret accumulation of knowledge—a gradual spread of 
enlightenment—ultimately a proletarian rebellion—the over¬ 
throw of the Party. You foresaw yourself that that was what 
it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians will never 
revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I 
do not have to tell you the reason; you know it already. If you 
have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you 
must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can 
be overthrown. The rule of the Party is forever. Make that 
the starting point of your thoughts.” 

He came closer to the bed. “Forever!” he repeated. “And 
now let us get back to the question of ‘how’ and ‘why.* You 
understand well enough how the Party maintains itself in 
power. Now tell me why we cling to power. What is our mo¬ 
tive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,” he added 
as Winston remained silent. 

Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or 
two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, 
mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into O’Brien’s face. 
He knew in advance what O’Brien would say: that the Party 
did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of 
the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass 
were frail, cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty 
or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically 
deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. That 
the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happi¬ 
ness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was 
better. That the Party was the eternal guardian of the weak, 
a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come, sacrificing 
its own happiness to that of others. The terrible thing, thought 
Winston, the terrible thing was that when O’Brien said this he 
would believe it. You could see it in his face. O’Brien knew 
‘-verything. A thousand times better than Winston, he knew 

199 


what the world was really like, in what degradation the mass 
of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the 
Party kept them there. He had understood it all, weighed 
all, and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate 
purpose. What can you do, thought Winston, against the 
lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your 
arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy? 

“You are ruling over us for our own good," he said feebly. 
"You believe that human beings are not fit to govern them¬ 
selves, and therefore—” 

He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot 
through his body. O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial 
up to thirty-five. 

“That was stupid, Winston, stupid!” he said. "You should 
know better than to say a thing like that.” 

He pulled the lever back and continued: 

"Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. 
The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not 
interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in 
power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness; only 
power, pure power. What pure power means you will un¬ 
derstand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies 
of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the 
others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards 
and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Com¬ 
munists came very close to us in their methods, but they 
never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They 
pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized 
power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round 
the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be 
free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one 
ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power 
is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictator¬ 
ship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolu¬ 
tion in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of per¬ 
secution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The 
object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand 


me: 


Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the 
tiredness of O'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and brutal, 
it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion be¬ 
fore which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. There 
were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheek¬ 
bones^ O’Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the 


worn face nearer. 

“You are thinking,” he said, “that my face is 

200 


old and tiredt 


You are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even 

able to prevent the decay of my own body Can you not 
tf.derstand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell. The 
weariness of the cell is the vigor of the organism. Do you 

die when you cut your fingernails? 

He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and 

down again, one hand in his pocket. _ 

“We are the priests of power,” he said. "God is power. 
But at present power is only a word so far as you are con¬ 
cerned. It is time for you to gather some idea of what power 
means. The first thing you must realize is that power is col¬ 
lective. The individual only has power in so far as he ceases 
to be an individual. You know the Party slogan ‘Freedom 
is Slavery.’ Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? 
Slavery is freedom. Alone—free—the human being is always 
defeated. It must be so, because every human being is doomed 
to die, which is the greatest of all failures. But if he can make 
complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity, 
if he can merge himself in the Party so that he is the Party, 
then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for 
you to realize is that power is power over human beings. 
Over the body—but, above all, over the mind. Power over 
matter—external reality, as you would call il—is not impor¬ 
tant. Already our control over matter is absolute.” 

For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a vio¬ 
lent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and merely 
^succeeded in wrenching his body painfully. 

“But how can you control matter?" he burst out. “You 
don’t even control the climate or the law of gravity. And there 
are disease, pain, death—” 

i O'Brien silenced him by a movement of the hand. “We 
control matter because we control the mind. Reality is inside 
i the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston. There is noth¬ 
ing that we could not do. Invisibility, levitation—anything. I 
; could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wished to. I 
1 do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You must 
get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of 
1 nature. We make the laws of nature.” 

“But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. 
What about Earasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered 
them yet.” 

i Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. 
, And if we did not, what difference would it make? We can 
shut them out of existence. Oceania is the world.” 

“ But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is 
# 201 


tiny—helpless! How long has he been in existence? For mil¬ 
lions of years the earth was uninhabited.” 

“Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. Hoy 
could it be older? Nothing exists except through human con¬ 
sciousness.” 

“But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals 
mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived 
here long before man was ever heard of.” 

“Have you ever seen those bones. Winston? Of course not. 
Nineteenth-century biologists invented them. Before man 
there was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, 
there would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing. 

“But the whole universe it outside us. Look at the stars. 
Some of them are a million light-years away. They are out 


of our reach forever." . , 

“What are the stars?” said O’Brien indifferently. They 

are bits of fire a few kilometers away. We could reach them 
if we wanted to. Or we could blot them out. The earth jswe 
center of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it. 

Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he 
did not say anything. O’Brien continued as though answer¬ 
ing a spoken objection: 4 A „ 

“For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When 

we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we 
often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round 
the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions o 
kilometers away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond 
us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be 
near or distant, according as we need them. Do you_ ™PP° S 
our mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you for 0 ott 

d °Winston" shrank back upon the bed Whatever he said 
the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeom And yet he 
knew he knew that he was in the right. The belict tna 

nothing exists outside your own mind—!surely f ,h " e be 

some way of demonstrating that it was false. Had it not 
been exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was eveni a. na 
for it, which he had forgotten. A fa.nt smile twitched 
corners of O'Brien's mouth as he looked down at him. 

•" told you, Winston,” he said, “that metaphysics ,s no 
your strong point. The word you are trying to think o 
solipsism. But you are mistaken. This is n °t sol ‘P s . . 

lective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing ^ 
f'ict the opposite thing. All tins is a digression, 
in a' different tone. "The real power, the power we have to 
fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over 

202 


men.” He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air 
of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: How aoes 
A-'ne man assert his power over another, Winston. 

Winston thought. ‘‘By making him suffer, he said. 

“Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. 
Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obey¬ 
ing your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain 
and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces 
and putting them together again in new shapes of your own 
choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we 
are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic 
Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world ot tear 
and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being 
trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but wore 
merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be 
progress toward more pain. The old civilizations claimed 
that they were founded on love and justice. Ours is founded 
upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except 
fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we 
. shall destroy—everything. Already we are breaking down 
the habits of thought which have survived from before the 
Revolution. We have cut the links between child and par¬ 
ent, and between man and man, and between man and 
woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any 
longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no 
T.iends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, 
as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradi¬ 
cated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the re¬ 
newal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our 
neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no 
loyalty, except loyalty toward the Party. There will be no 
love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, 
except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There 
will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnip¬ 
otent we shall have no more need of science. There will be 
no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no 
curiosity, no employment of the process of life. All compet¬ 
ing pleasures will be destroyed. But always—do not forget 
this, Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, 
constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, 
at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sen¬ 
sation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want 
a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human 
face—forever.” 

He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Win- 
i von had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again. 

203 


He could not say anything. His heart seemed to be frozen. 
O'Brien went on: 

“And remember that it is forever. The face will always*' 
be there to be stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of so¬ 
ciety, will always be there, so that he can be defeated and 
humiliated over again. Everything that you have undergone 
since you have been in our hands—all that will continue, 
and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the 
tortures, the executions, the disappearances will never cease. 

It will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. 
The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant; 
the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Gold¬ 
stein and his heresies will live forever. Every day, at every 
moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat 
upon—and yet they will always survive. This drama that I 
have played out with you during seven years will be played out 
over and over again, generation after generation, always in 
subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at our 
mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible- and 
in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to 
our feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are 
preparing, Winston. A world of victory after victory, triumph 
after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, 
pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I can 
see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you 
will do more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome*- 

it, become part of it.” . . „ v 

Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak. You 

can’t!” he said weakly. 

“What do you mean by that remark, Winston/ 

“You could not create such a world as you have just de¬ 
scribed. It is a dream. It is impossible.” 


“Why?’* 

“It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred 
and cruelty. It would never endure.” 

"Irwoiild have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would 

commit suicide.” h _ trPf j is 

“Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is 

more exhausting than love. Why should it be? And if it were, 

what difference would that make? Suppose that we choose 

£ wear ourselves ou, faster. Suppose that »e &lt;,u,ck n «h 

tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty Still 

difference would it make? Can you not understand that the 

death of the individual is not death? The Party is imm ■ 

As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helpless 

204 


ness. Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his 
disagreement O’Brien would twist the dial again. And yet 
f he could not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments, with 
nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what 
O’Brien had said, he returned to the attack. 

“I don’t know—I don’t care. Somehow you will fail. Some¬ 
thing will defeat you. Life will defeat you.” 

“We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imagin¬ 
ing that there is something called human nature which will be 
outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we 
create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable. Or per¬ 
haps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians 
or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out of your 
mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity is the 
Party. The others are outside—irrelevant.” 

“I don’t care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later 
they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear 
you to pieces.” 

“Do you see any evidence that this is happening? Or any 
reason why it should?” 

“No. I believe it. I know that you will fail. There is some¬ 
thing in the universe—I don’t know, some spirit, some prin¬ 
ciple—that you will never overcome.” 

“Do you believe in God, Winston?” 

“No.” 

p “Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?” 

“I don’t know. The spirit of Man.” 

“And do you consider yourself a man?” 

“Yes.” 

“If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your 
kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand 
that you are alone? You are outside history, you are non¬ 
existent.” His manner changed and he said more harshly: 
“And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our 
lies and our cruelty?” 

“Yes, I consider myself superior.” 

O’Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. 
After a moment Winston recognized one of them as his 
own. It was a sound track of the conversation he had had 
with O’Brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself in 
the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal, 
to forge, to murder, to encourage drug taking and prostitu¬ 
tion, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a 
child’s face. O’Brien made a small impatient gesture, as 
Uiough to say that the demonstration was hardly worth mak- 
ing. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped. 

205 - 


“Get up from that bed,” he said. 

The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered 
himself to the floor and stood up unsteadily. 

“You are the last man,” said O’Brien. “You are the guardian 
of the human spirit. You shall see yourself as you are. Take 
off your clothes.” 

Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls to¬ 
gether. The zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of 
them. He could not remember whether at any time since his 
arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time. Beneath 
the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags, 
just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid 
them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror 
at the far end of the room. He approached it, then stopped 
short. An involuntary cry had broken out of him. 

“Go on,” said O’Brien. “Stand between the wings of the 
mirror. You shall see the side view as well.” 

He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, gray- 
colored, skeletonlike thing was coming toward him. Its actual 
appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he 
knew it to be himself. He moved closer to the glass. The 
creature’s face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent 
carriage. A forlorn, jailbird’s face with a nobby forehead 
running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose and battered- 
looking cheekbones above which the eyes were fierce and 
watchful. The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn- 
in look. Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him 
that it had changed more than he had changed inside. The 
emotions it registered would be different from the ones he 
felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he had 
thought that he had gone gray as well, but it was only the 
scalp^ that was gray. Except for his hands and a circle of his 
face, his body was gray all over with ancient, ingrained dirt. 
Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of 
wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed 
mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly fn ghten- 
ing thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the 
ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton; the legs had shrunk 
so that the knees were thicker than the thighs. He saw now 
what O'Brien had meant about seeing the side v, * w - T h 
curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders 
were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the 
scraggy* neck seemed to be bending double under the weight 
of the skull. At a guess he would have said that it was the 

body of a man of sixty, suffering from so ^ e n ^ R a ’|^ ar !! ^' Sea ^ e y 
“You have thought sometimes, said O Bran, that my 

206 


t_ 


I 


f ace —the face of a member of the Inner Party looks old 
and worn. What do you think of your own face?” 

He seized Winston’s shoulder and spun him round so that 

he was facing him. 

“Look at the condition you are in!” he said. “Look at this 
filthy grime all over your body. Look at the dirt between 
your toes. Look at that disgusting running sore on your leg. 
Do you know that you stink like a goat? Probably you have 
ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do you see? I 
can make my thumb and forefinger meet around your bicep. 

I could snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you 
have lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our 
hands? Even your hair is coming out in handfuls. Look!” 
He plucked at Winston’s head and brought away a tuft of hair. 
“Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many 
had you when you came to us? And the few you have left 
are dropping out of your head. Look here!” 

He seized one of Winston’s remaining front teeth between 
his powerful thumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain shot 
through Winston’s jaw. O’Brien had wrenched the loose tooth 
out by the roots. He tossed it across the cell. 

“You are rotting away,” he said; “you are falling to pieces. 
What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn round and look into 
that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? That is 
the last man. If you are human, that is humanity. Now put 
your clothes on again.” 

Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. 
Until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak 
he was. Only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must 
have been in this place longer than he had imagined. Then 
suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feel¬ 
ing of pity for his ruined body overcame him. Before he 
knew what he was doing he had collapsed onto a small stool 
that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. He was aware 
of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle ol bones in filthy 
underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light; but he 
could not stop himself. O’Brien laid a hand on his shoulder, 
almost kindly. 

“It will not last forever,” he said. “You can escape from it 
whenever you choose. Everything depends on yourself." 

“You did it!” sobbed Winston. “You reduced me to this 
state.” 

“No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you 
accepted when you set yourself up against the Party. It was 
all contained in that first act. Nothing has happened that you 
did not foresee." 


207 


He paused, and then went on: 

“We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. 

You have seen what your body is like. Your mind is in the &gt; 
same state. I do not think there can be much pride left in you. 

You have been kicked and flogged and insulted, you have 
screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in your own 
blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have 
betrayed everybody and everything. Can you think of a single 

degradation that has not happened to you?” 

Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still 

oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O Brien. 

“I have not betrayed Julia,” he said. 

O’Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. “No,” he said, 
“no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.” 

The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothing seemed 
able to destroy, flooded Winston’s heart again. How intelligent, 
he thought, how intelligent! Never did O’Brien fail to under¬ 
stand what was said to him. Anyone else on earth would 
have answered promptly that he had betrayed Julia, ror 
what was there that they had not screwed out of him under 
the torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, 
her habits, her character, her past life; he had confessed in 
the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their 
meetings, all that he had said to her and she to him, their 
black-market meals, their adulteries, their vague plottings 
against the Party-cverything. And yet, in the sense in which r 
he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. H. had not 
stopped loving her; his feeling toward her had remained the 
same. O'Brien had seen what he meant without the need 

explanation. , *&gt;&lt;» 

“Tell me,” he said, “how soon will they shoot me? 

“It might be a long time,” said O'Brien. ‘ You are a diffiea 

case. But don’t give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or 

later. In the end we shall shoot you." 


He was much better. He was growing fatter and stronger 
every day, if it was proper to speak of days.

others^he had been in. There were . pillow and a. 
on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on -J^ey had ^ 

a ba ?’ an a t^asKey^ven 0 him warm water to f 
wash with. They had given him new underclothes and a c ean 

20S 


suit of overalls. They had dressed his varicose ulcer with 
soothing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants of his 
^ teeth and given him a new set of dentures. 

Weeks or months must have passed. It would have been 
possible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he had 
felt any interest in doing so, since he was being fed at what 
appeared to be regular intervals. He was getting, he judged, 
three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he won¬ 
dered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. 
The food was surprisingly good, with meat at every third 
meal. Once there was even a packet of cigarettes. He had no 
matches, but the never-speaking guard who brought his food 
would give him a light. The first time he tried to smoke it 
made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out 
for a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal. 

They had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil 
tied to the corner. At first he made no use of it. Even when 
he was awake he was completely torpid. Often he would lie 
from one meal to the next almost without stirring, sometimes 
asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was 
too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown used 
to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed to make 
no difference, except that one’s dreams were more coherent. 
He dreamed a great deal all through this time, and they were 
always happy dreams. He was in the Golden Country, or he 
• was sitting among enormous, glorious, sunlit ruins, with his 
mother, with Julia, with O’Brien—not doing anything, merely 
sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. Such thoughts 
as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. 
He seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now 
that the stimulus of pain had been removed. He was not 
bored; he had no desire for conversation or distraction. 
Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned, to have 
enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was completely satis¬ 
fying. 

By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still 
felt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie 
quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body. He would 
finger himself here and there, trying to make sure that it was 
not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and 
his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a doubt 
that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely 
thicker than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he began 
exercising himself regularly. In a little while he could walk 
three kilometers, measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed 
shoulders were growing straighter. He attempted more elabo- 

209 


rate exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to find what 
things he could not do. He could not move out of a walk, he 
could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not r 
stand on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on 
his heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and 
calf he could just lift himself to a standing position. He lay 
flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands. It 
was hopeless; he could not raise himself a centimeter. But 
after a few more days—a few more mealtimes—even that 
feat was accomplished. A time came when he could do it six 
times running. He began to grow actually proud of his body, 
and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was 
"rowing back to normal. Only when he chanced to put his 
hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined 
face that had looked back at him out of the mirror 

His mind grew more active. He sat down on the P^nk bed 
his back against the wall and the slate on his knees, and set 
to work deliberately at the task of re-educating himself. 

He had capitulated; that was agreed. In reality as he sa 
now he had been ready to capitulate long before he had 
taken the decision. From the moment when he waj; ms.dc th 
Ministry of Love—and yes, even during those minutes when 
he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from th 
telescreen told them what to do-he graspedthe_fn&gt; Y- 
the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against n 
power of the Party. He knew now that for seven years the * 
Thought Police had watched him like a beetle under a mag i 

played sound tracks to him shown him P h ° , 0 ^ a P hS ev S e ° me

to write down the thoughts that came mto his head. He 
wrote first in large clumsy capitals: 

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. 

Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it: ^ 

TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE. 

210 


But then there came a sort of check. His mind, as though 
shying away from something, seemed unable to concentrate, 
ile knew that he knew what came next, but for the moment 
he could not recall it. When he did recall it, it was only by 
consciously reasoning out what it must be; it did not come of 
its own accord. He wrote: 

GOD IS POWER. 

He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past 
never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. 
Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. Jones, Aaron- 
son, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were 
charged with. He had never seen the photograph that dis¬ 
proved their guilt. It had never existed; he had invented it. 
He remembered remembering contrary things, but those were 
false memories, products of self-deception. How easy it all 
was! Only surrender, and everything else followed. It was 
like swimming against a current that swept you backwards 
however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to 
turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it. 
Nothing had changed except your own attitude; the predes¬ 
tined thing happened in any case. He hardly knew why he 
had ever rebelled. Everything was easy, except—! 

Anything could be true. The so-called laws of nature were 
"nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. “If I wished," 
O'Brien had said, “I could float off this floor like a soap 
bubble.” Winston worked it out. “If he thinks he floats off the 
floor, and if I simultaneously think I see him do it, then the 
thing happens.” Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreck¬ 
age breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his 
mind: "It doesn’t really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucina¬ 
tion.” He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was 
obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside 
oneself, there was a “real” world where “real” things hap¬ 
pened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge 
have we of anything, save through our own minds? All hap¬ 
penings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly 
happens. 

He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he 
was in no danger of succumbing to it. He realized, neverthc- 
less, that it ought never to have occurred to him. The mind 
should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought 
presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. 
Crime stop, they called it in Newspeak. 

He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He pre- 

211 


sented himself with propositions—“the Party says the earth 
is flat.” "the Party says that ice is heavier than water and^_ 
trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the argu¬ 
ments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed great 
powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical 
problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as two 
and two make five" were beyond his intellectual grasp. It 
needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one 
moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the 
next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors. Stupidity 
was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain. 

All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how 
soon they would shoot him. “Everything depends on yourselt. 
O'Brien had said; but he knew that there was no conscious 
act by which he could bring it nearer. It might be ten minutes 
hence, or ten years. They might keep him for Y ears y 

confinement; they might send him to a labor car "P’ they m ‘%! 
release him for a while, as they sometimes did It was per¬ 
fectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of 
his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again. 
The one certain thing was that death never came at an ex¬ 
pected moment. The tradition—the unspoken tradition: some¬ 
how you knew it, though you never heard Usaid—w*is that 
they shot you from behind, always in the back of the head

hazard h.tnseU cry a,cud: 


•‘Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia! lf . . 

For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination 

tfrher presence. She had seemed to be not merely with him, 
|ut inside him. It was as though she had got into the texture 
af his skin. In that moment he had loved her far more than 
ne had ever done when they were together and free. Also he 
knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed 
his help. 

He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himselt. 
What had he done? How many years had he added to his 
servitude by that moment of weakness? 

In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots out¬ 
side. They could not let such an outburst go unpunished, 
rhey would know now, if they had not known before, that 
he was breaking the agreement he had made with them. He 
obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days 
he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of 
conformity. Now he had retreated a step further: in the mind 
fie had surrendered, but he had hoped to keep the inner heart 
inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, and he preferred 
to be in the wrong. They would understand that—O’Brien 
would understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish 
cry. 

; He would have to start all over again. It might take years. 
He ran a hand over his face, trying to familiarize himself 
^,ith the new shape. There were deep furrows in the cheeks, 
:he cheekbones felt sharp, the nose flattened. Besides, since 
last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete 
new set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve inscrutability 
when you did not know what your face looked like. In any 
case, mere control of the features was not enough. For the 
first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you 
must also hide it from yourself. You must know all the while 
that it is there, but until it is needed you must never let it 
femerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be 
given a name. From now onwards he must not only think 
right; he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he 
must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter 
which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest 
of him, a kind of cyst. 

One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not 
tell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand it 
should be possible to guess. It was always from behind, walk¬ 
ing down a corridor. Ten seconds would be enough. In that 
lime the world inside him could turn over. And then suddenly, 
Without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without 

213 


the changing of a line in his face—suddenly the camouflage 
would be down and bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. 
Hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame. Amf 
almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, 
or too early. They would have blown his brain to pieces be¬ 
fore they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be un¬ 
punished, unrepented, out of their reach forever. They would 
have blown a hole in their own perfection. To die hating them, 
that was freedom. 

He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an 
intellectual discipline. It was a question of degrading himself, 
mutilating himself. He had got to plunge into the filthiest of 
filth. What was the most horrible, sickening thing of all? He 
thought of Big Brother. The enormous face (because of con¬ 
stantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being 
a meter wide), with its heavy black mustache and the eyes 
that followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind 
of its own accord. What were his true feelings toward Big 
Brother? 

There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The steel 
door swung open with a clang. O'Brien walked into the celt 
Behind him were the waxen-faced officer and the black-uni¬ 
formed guards. 

“Get up,” said O’Brien. “Come here.” 

Winston stood opposite him. O’Brien took Winston’s shoul¬ 
ders between his strong hands and looked at him closely, r 

“You have had thoughts of deceiving me,” he said. ‘That 
was stupid. Stand up straighter. Look me in the face.” 

He paused, and went on in a gentler tone: 

“You are improving. Intellectually there is very little wrong 
with you. It is only emotionally that you have failed to make 
progress. Tell me, Winston—and remember, no lies; you 
know that I am always able to detect a lie—tell me, what are 
your true feelings toward Big Brother?” 

“I hate him.” 

“You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you to 
take the last step. You must love Big Brother. It is not enough 

to obey him; you must love him." 

He released Winston with a little push toward the guards. 

“Room 101,” he said. 


v 

At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed 
to know, whereabouts he was in the windowless building. 
Possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure. Thfc 

214 


cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground 
level. The room where he had been interrogated by OBnen 
A/as high up near the roof. This place was many meters under¬ 
ground, as deep down as it was possible to go. _ 

It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he 
hardly noticed his surroundings. All he noticed was that there 
were two small tables straight in front of him, each covered 
with green baize. One was only a meter or two from him; the 
other was further away, near the door. He was strapped up¬ 
right in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not 
even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, 
forcing him to look straight in front of him. 

For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and 

O'Brien came in. 

“You asked me once,” said O’Brien, “what was in Room 
101. I told you that you knew the answer already. Everyone 
knows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing 
in the world.” 

The door opened again. A guard came in. carrying some¬ 
thing made of wire, a box or basket of some kind. He set it 
down on the further table. Because of the position in which 
O’Brien was standing, Winston could not see what the thing 
was. 

“The worst thing in the world,” said O’Brien, “varies from 
individual to individual. It may be burial alive, or death by 
“re, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other deaths. 
There are cases where it is some quite trivial thing, not even 
fatal.” 

He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a 
better view of the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire 
cage with a handle on top for carrying it by. Fixed to the 
front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask, 
with the concave side outwards. Although it was three or four 
meters away from him, he could see that the cage was divided 
lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some 
kind of creature in each. They were rats. 

“In your case.” said O’Brien, “the worst thing in the world 
. happens to be rats.” 

A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain 
what, had passed through Winston as soon as he caught his 
first glimpse of the cage. But at this moment the meaning of 
the maskiike attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him. 
His bowels seemed to turn to water. 

“You can’t do that!” he cried out in a high cracked voice. 
“You couldn’t, you couldn’t! It’s impossible.” 

■f “Do you remember,” said O’Brien, “the moment of panic 

* / 215 

1 


that used to occur in your dreams? There was a wall of black¬ 
ness in front of you, and a roaring sound in your ears. There 
was something terrible on the other side of the wall. Yotf 
knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it 
into the open. It was the rats that were on the other side of 
the wall.” 

“O'Brien!” said Winston, making an effort to control his 
voice. “You know this is not necessary. What is it that you 
want me to do?” 

O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in 
the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected. He 
looked thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were ad¬ 
dressing an audience somewhere behind Winston’s back. 

“By itself,” he said, “pain is not always enough. There are 
occasions when a human being will stand out against pain, 
even to the point of death. But for everyone there is some¬ 
thing unendurable—something that cannot be contemplated. 
Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling 
from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you 
have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your 
lungs with air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be dis¬ 
obeyed. It is the same with the rats. For you, they are unen¬ 
durable. They are a form of pressure that you cannot with¬ 
stand, even if you wish to. You will do what is required of 
you.” 

“But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don’t knovP 
what it is?” 

O’Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the 
nearer table. He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. 
Winston could hear the blood singing in his ears. He had the 
feeling of sitting in utter loneliness. He was in the middle of 
a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight, 
across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances. 
Yet the cage with the rats was not two meters away from him. 
They were enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat s 
muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of 
gray. 

“The rat,” said O’Brien, still addressing his invisible audi¬ 
ence, “although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of 
that. You will have heard of the things that happen in the 
poor quarters of this town. In some streets a woman dare 
not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes. 
The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time 
they will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying 
people. They show astonishing intelligence in knowing when 
a human being is helpless." 


216 


There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed 
to reach Winston from far away. The rats were fighting: they 
V^re trying to get at each other through the partition. He 
b *ard also a deep groan of despair. That, too, seemed to come 
from outside himself. 

O’Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so. pressed 
something in it. There was a sharp click. Winston made a 
frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. It was 
hopeless: every part of him. even his head, was held immov¬ 
ably. O’Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a 
meter from Winston’s face. 

“I have pressed the first lever.” said O'Brien. “You under¬ 
stand the construction of this cage. The mask will fit over 
your head, leaving no exit. When I press this other lever, the 
door of the cage will slide up. These starving brutes will shoot 
out of it like bullets. Have you ever seen a rat leap through 
the air? They will leap onto your face and bore straight into 
it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes they bur¬ 
row through the cheeks and devour the tongue.” 

The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a 
succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in 
the air above his head. But he fought furiously against his 
panic. To think, to think, even with a split second left—to 
think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odor of the 
brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of 
■&gt;jsea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Every¬ 
thing had gone black. For an instant he was insane, a scream¬ 
ing animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutching an 
idea. There was one and only one way to save himself. He 
must interpose another human being, the body of another 
human being, between himself and the rats. 

The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out 
the vision of anything else. The wire door was a couple of 
hand-spans from his face. The rats knew what was coming 
now. One of them was leaping up and down; the other, an 
old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink 
hands against the bars, and fiercely snuffed the air. Winston 
could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black 
panic took hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless. 

“It was a common punishment in Imperial China,” said 
O’Brien as didactically as ever. 

The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his 
cheek. And then—no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny 
fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps too late. But he had 
suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just 
person to whom he could transfer his punishment —one 
e 2 17 


body that he could thrust between himself and the rats. And 
he was shouting frantically, over and over: 

“Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don’t cai^ 
what you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. 
Not me! Julia! Not me!” 

He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away 
from the rats. He was still strapped in the chair, but he had 
fallen through the floor, through the walls of the building, 
through the earth, through the oceans, through the atmos¬ 
phere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars— 
always away, away, away from the rats. He was light-years 
distant, but O'Brien was still standing at his side. There was 
still the cold touch of a wire against his cheek. But through 
the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic 
click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not 
open. 

vt 


The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight 
slanting through a window fell yellow on dusty tabletops. It 
was the lonely hour of fifteen. A tinny music trickled from 
the telescreens. 

Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. 
Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him 
from the opposite wall. Bio Brother Is Watching You, t!fc 
caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and filled his glass up 
with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from another 
bottle with a quill through the cork. It was saccharine flavored 

with cloves, the specialty of the cafe. 

Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present only 
music was coming out of it, but there was a possibility that 
many moment there might be a special bullet,n from the 
Ministry of Peace. The news from the African front was 
quicimo in the extreme. On and off he had been worrying 
about il all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war wA

stopped thinking about the war. In these days he could never 
fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments 
^»t a time. He picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp. As 
always, it made him shudder and even retch slightly. The 
stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine, themselves 
disgusting enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the 
flat oily smell; and what was worst of all was that the smell 
of gin, which dwelt with him night and day, was inextricably 
mixed up in his mind with the smell of those- 

He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as 
it was possible he never visualized them. They were some¬ 
thing that he was half aware of, hovering close to his face, a 
smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin rose in him he 
belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they 
released him, and had regained his old color—indeed, more 
than regained it. His features had thickened, the skin on nose 
and cheekbones was coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too 
deep a pink. A waiter, again unbidden, brought the chess¬ 
board and the current issue of the Times, with the page turned 
down at the chess problem. Then, seeing that Winston’s glass 
was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was 
no need to give orders. They knew his habits. The chessboard 
was always waiting for him, his corner table was always re¬ 
served; even when the place was full he had it to himself, 
since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him. He 
“.ever even bothered to count his drinks. At irregular intervals 
they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said 
was the bill, but he had the impression that they always under¬ 
charged him. It would have made no difference if it had been 
the other way about. He had always plenty of money nowa¬ 
days. He even had a job, a sinecure, more highly paid than 
his old job had been. 

The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took 
over. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletin from the 
front, however. It was merely a brief announcement from the 
Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter, it appeared, the 
Tenth Three-Year Plan's quota for bootlaces had been over¬ 
fulfilled by ninety-eight per cent. 

He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It 
was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. “White to 
play and mate in two moves.” Winston looked up at the 
portrait of Big Brother. White always mates, he thought with 
a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is 
j so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the 
V orld has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, 
t ? 219 


unvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed 
back at him, full of calm power. White always mates. 

The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a diH 
ferent and much graver tone: “You are warned to stand by 
for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty. Fifteen- 
thirty! This is news of the highest importance. Take care not 
to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!” The tinkling music struck up again. 

Winston’s heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the 
front; instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming. 
All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought of a 
smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his mind. 
He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming across 
the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of 
Africa like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible 
to outflank them in some way? The outline of the West 
African coast stood out vividly in his mind. He picked up the 
white knight and moved it across the board. There was the 
proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing south¬ 
ward he saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly 
planted in their rear, cutting their communications by land 
and sea. He felt that by willing it he was bringing that other 
force into existence. But it was necessary to act . f q “J? v y L a i 
they could get control of the whole of Africa if they had 
airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it w 
Oceania in two. It might mean anything: defeat 
the redivision of the world, the destruction of the Party. W 
drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medley of feelings 
but it was P not a medley, exactly; rather it was s «ccessi 
layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was

hlI , for the moment he could not settle down to serious study 
o .ta chess problem. His thoughts wandered aga.n. A mm, 
unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table. 

2 + 2 = 5.

Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the 
Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like 
il^». and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud 
anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed them¬ 
selves up to be dismembered by the wind. He was hurrying 
along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her 
not ten meters away from him. It struck him at once that she 
had changed in some ill-defined way. They almost passed one 
another without a sign; then he turned and followed her, not 
very eagerly. He knew that there was no danger, nobody 
would take any interest in them. She did not speak. She walked 
obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of 
him, then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. 
Presently they were in among a clump of ragged leatless 
shrubs, useless either for concealment or as protection from 
the wind. They halted. It was vilely cold. The wind whistled 
through the twigs and fretted the occasional, dirty-looking 
crocuses. He put his arm round her waist. 

There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden micro¬ 
phones; besides, they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing 
mattered. They could have lain down on the ground and done 
that if they had wanted to. His flesh froze with horror at the 
thought of it. She made no response whatever to the clasp 
of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He 
knew now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, 
av.d there was a long scar, partly hidden by the hair, across 
her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. It was 
that her waist had grown thicker and, in a surprising way, 
had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion 
of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some 
ruins, and had been astonished not only by the incredible 
weight of the thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness to 
handle, which made it seem more like stone than flesh. Her 
body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture of her 
skin would be quite different from what it had once been. 

He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As 
they walked back across the gate she looked directly at him 
for the first time. It was only a momentary glance, full of 
contempt and dislike. He wondered whether it was a dislike 
that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired 
also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept 
squeezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, 
side by side but not too close together. He saw that she was 

« \j U V?t Spea ' C ' moved her clumsy shoe a few centimeters 
deliberately crushed a twig. Her feet seemed to have 
e own broader, he noticed.

“I betrayed you,” she said baldly. 

“I betrayed you,” he said. 

She gave him another quick look of dislike. 1 

'Sometimes,” she said, “they threaten you with something 
—something you can’t stand up to, can’t even think about. 
And then you say. Don’t do it to me. do it to somebody else, 
do it to so-and-so.’ And perhaps you might pretend, after¬ 
wards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to 
make them stop and didn't really mean it. But that isn’t true. 
At the time when it happens you do mean it. You think there’s 
no other way of saving yourself, and you’re quite ready to 
save yourself that way. You want it to happen to the other 
person. You don't give a damn what they suffer. All you care 
about is yourself.” 

“All you care about is yourself,” he echoed. 

“And after that, you don't feel the same toward the other 
person any longer.” 

“No,” he said, “you don’t feel the same.” 

There did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind 
plastered their thin overalls against their bodies. Almost at 
once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence; besides, it 
was too cold to keep still. She said something about catching 
her Tube and stood up to go. 

“We must meet again,” he said. 

“Yes,” she said, “we must meet again.” - 

He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace 
behind her. They did not speak again. She did not actually 
try to shake him off, but walked at just such a speed as to 
prevent his keeping abreast of her. He had made up his mind 
that he would accompany her as far as the Tube station, but 
suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed 
pointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire 
not so much to get away from Julia as to get back to the 
Chestnut Tree Cafe, which had never seemed so attractive 
as at this moment. He had a nostalgic vision of his corner 
table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the ever- 
flowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. J^e next 
moment, not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to 
become separated from her by a small knot of people, e 
made a half-hearted attempt to catch up, then slowed down, 
turned and made off in the opposite direction. When he a 
gone fifty meters he looked back. The street was not crowde , 
but already he could not distinguish her. Any one of a dozen 
hurrying figures might have been hers. Perhaps her thickene , 
stiffened body was no longer recognizable from behind, i 

“At the time when it happens,” she had said, “you do mean 

222 




it.” He had meant it. He had not merely said it. he had wished 
it. He had wished that she and not he should be delivered 
over to the - 

Something changed in the music that trickled from the 
telescreen. A cracked and jeering note, a yellow note, came 
into it. And then—perhaps it was not happening, perhaps it 
was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound—a 
voice was singing: 

“Under the spreading chestnut tree 
/ sold you and you sold me —" 


The tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed 
that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle. 

He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not 
less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank. But it 
had become the element he swam in. It was his life, his death, 
and his resurrection. It was gin that sank him into stupor 
every night, and gin that revived him every morning. When 
he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up 
eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, 
it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal 
if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the 
bed overnight. Through the mid-day hours he sat with glazed 

i^face, the bottle handy, listening to the telescreen. From fifteen 
to closing time he was a fixture in the Chestnut Tree. No one 
cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him. no tele¬ 
screen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, 
he went to a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry 
of Truth and did a little work, or what was called work. He 
had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee 
which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees 
dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation 
of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak dictionary. They 
were engaged in producing something called an Interim Re- 
port, but what it was that they were reporting on he had never 
definitely found out. It was something to do with the question 
^whether commas should be placed inside brackets, or out¬ 
side. There were four others on the committee, all of them 
persons similar to himself. There were days when they as¬ 
sembled and then promptly dispersed again, frankly admitting 
to one another that there was not really anything to be done. 
But there were other days when they settled down to their 
work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show of entering 

* * hei I “ S draftin 8 !°ng memoranda which were 
never finished—when the argument as to what they were 

223 



supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and 
abstruse, with subtle hagglings over definitions, enormous ^ 
digressions, quarrels—threats, even, to appeal to higher au- J 
thority. And then suddenly the life would go out of them and 
they would sit round the table looking at one another with 
extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow. 

The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his 
head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merely changing 
the music. He had the map of Africa behind his eyelids. The 
movement of the armies was a diagram: a black arrow tear¬ 
ing vertically southward, and a white arrow tearing horizon¬ 
tally eastward, across the tail of the first. As though for reas¬ 
surance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. 
Was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist? 

His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful of 
gin, picked up the white knight, and made a tentative move. 
Check. But it was evidently not the right move, because— 
Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a candle¬ 
lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed, and himself, a 
boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor, shaking a dice box 
and laughing excitedly. His mother was sitting opposite him 

and also laughing. 

It must have been about a month before she disappeared. 
It was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hunger 
in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her 
had temporarilv revived. He remembered the day well, a 
pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the 
window pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by. 
The boredom of the two children in the dark, cramped be - 
room became unbearable. Winston whined and graded, made 
futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling every¬ 
thing out of place and kicking the wainscoting until ■he 
neighbors banged on the wall, while the younger child wailed 
intermittently .^In the end his mother had said, ^ow be good 
and I’ll buy you a toy. A lovely toy—you 11 love it , and then

ud the ladders and then came slithering

lacain, almost back to the starting point. They played I eig 
fr.mes, winning four each. His tiny sister, too young to&gt; under 
jftand what the game was about, had sat propped up against a 
bolster, laughinc because the others were laughing, for a 
whole afternoon they had all been happy together, as in ms 

earlier childhood. , . 

He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a ia sc 
memory. He was troubled by false memories occasionally. 
They did not matter so long as one knew them for what they 
were. Some*things had happened, others had not happened. 
He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white 
i knight again. Almost in the same instant it dropped onto the 
• board with a clatter. He had started as though a pin had run 


| into him. , , 

i A shrill trumpet call had pierced the air. It was the bulletin. 

Victory! It always meant victory when a trumpet call preceded 
j the news. A sort of electric thrill ran through the cafe. Even 
. the waiters had started and pricked up their ears. 

The trumpet call had let loose an enormous volume of 
! noise. Already an excited voice was gabbling from the tele- 
( screen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by a 
I roar of cheering from outside. The news had run round the 
1 streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what was 
issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened 
*~^s he had foreseen: a vast seaborne armada secretly assem- 
-l-oled, a sudden blow in the enemy’s rear, the white arrow 
tearing across the tail of the black. Fragments of triumphant 
phrases pushed themselves through the din: “Vast strategic 
maneuver—perfect co-ordination—utter rout—half a million 
i prisoners—complete demoralization—control of the whole of 
\ Africa—bring the war within measurable distance of its end 
; —victory—greatest victory in human history—victory, vic- 
, tory, victory!” 

Under the table Winston’s feet made convulsive move- 
j ments. He had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind he 
I was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds outside, 
cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at the portrait of 
Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world! The rock 
• against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! 
He thought how ten minutes ago—yes, only ten minutes— 
there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered 


whether the news from the front would be of victory or 
defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army that had 
perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in 
the Ministry of Love, but the final, indispensable, healing 
-change had never happened, until this moment.

The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth iti 
tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting 
outside had died down a little. The waiters were turning back 
to their work. One of them approached with the gin bottle? 
Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his. 
glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any &gt; 
longer. He was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything 
forgiven, his soul white as snow. He was in the public dock 
confessing everything, implicating everybody. He was walking 
down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in' 
sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The long-hoped-fo! I 
bullet was entering his brain. " 

He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken 
him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark 
mustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, 
self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented tears 
trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, every¬ 
thing was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the 
victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.
